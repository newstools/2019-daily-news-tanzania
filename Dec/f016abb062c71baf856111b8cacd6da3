BENJAMIN Mkapa Hospital (BMH) is adding up Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) treatment that breaks kidney stones into small pieces before travelling through the urinary tract and cause illness. That was said here yesterday by the hospital’s acting Executive Director Dr Kessy Shija, as he announced another investment of over 6bn/- launch next month for them. He said that the institution admits at least 32 patients on monthly basis seeking treatment for the disease against the initial five, when they started the surgery. BMH is the only public hospital that offers the service, and will also be providing endoscopic treatment and open surgery to help unblock the usually painful passage of urine in both women and men infected with the disease. According to the hospital’s head of Urology Department, Dr Remigius Rugakingila, while addressing journalists and Ministry of Health Public Relations Officers, kidney stone is currently one of the serious issues in public health and may remain in a patient’s kidney without showing any symptom(s). “But if the same stone begins to move out of your kidney, you may feel some pain and with time develop into cancer and finally death,” said the Urologist. He further said that kidney stones are as a result of low water intake and bacterial infections. Dr Rugakingila noted that a human kidney is a filter for the body and responsible for removing waste chemicals as well as excess fluid from the blood as urine. “However, if there is a buildup of chemicals in the kidney, they may form tiny crystals, which clump together as a kidney stone,” he said. In a related development, a survey by ‘Daily News’ found out that the hospital is still understaffed by technicians and professionals to man such a machine. Currently, it operates with 383 staff out of the needed 741. However, Dr Shija said the institution was grateful to the government for its continuous support to them including providing them with best medics and other professionals.
