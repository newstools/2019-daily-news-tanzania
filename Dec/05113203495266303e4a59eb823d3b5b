SCHOOLCHILDREN have asked the government to supply enough fire extinguishers and clear prescriptions to help curb fire accidents in both public primary and secondary schools. The call was made on Thursday by primary and secondary school student fire clubs established to provide grassroots education and training on fire prevention and rescue to adolescents. They said in their statement read to Home Affairs Minister Kangi Lugola at Dodoma Secondary School that schoolchildren were most vulnerable and having knowledge and proper equipment would help the government save lives, money and property whenever fire accidents occurred. “We urge the government to launch similar clubs across all public schools in the country. This can also be effective if fire education is included in school teaching curricula,” reads part of their statement to the minister. Since 2016, the fire and rescue unit has launched 327 clubs with 15,232 members across the country. The ceremony involved 650 schoolchildren from seven primary schools and six secondary schools. For his part, Mr Lugola said December 5 would be marked annually bringing all school clubs across the country to display their aptness in fighting and responding to fire incidents. The minister tasked Fire and Rescue Commissioner- General Thobias Andengenye to ensure such fire clubs were organised across all public and secondary schools as well as colleges and higher education institutions. He said the ministry would henceforth develop new regulations that would be abided by to ensure people and property’s safety. Mr Lugola was concerned about increasing cases of fire incidents. However, he said infrastructure and equipment were not friendly.
