TANZANIA beat Kenya 3-1 in the Match Day Three of the inaugural edition of the CECAFA U-17 Girlsâ€™ Championship at the FUFA Technical Centre in Njeru, Uganda yesterday.

It was the fifth goal of the campaign for Meshack. Aisha Masaka sealed the score with the third goal in the 70th minute. It was a perfect victory for the Bakari Shime charges as they needed nothing short of victory, to remain on course of winning the first silverware.
