THE Isles Ministry of Trade and Industries is organising a Trade Fair and Exhibition of services provided by various parastatals, from January 02 to 15 next year (2020). The Trade Fair is supported by the Tanzania Trade Development Authority (Tan Trade) and this is the sixth time to be organised since it was introduced as among events to celebrate the revolution anniversary. According to the Trade and Industries Minister, Ambassador Amina Salum Ali, the trade fair will feature different industrial and agricultural products from Zanzibar, mainland and outside Tanzania. About 290 companies and parastatals took part in the January 2019 Trade Fair, with participants from Rwanda, Kenya, Burundi, Uganda, and Egypt. “We expect about three hundred companies/groups/ institutions and hundreds of visitors at the Trade Fair venue to be held at Maisara grounds in Zanzibar,” Ms Ali informed journalists during a press conference here. She encouraged members of the business community to prepare to take part in the planned trade fair, which is among important events planned to celebrate the 56th anniversary of the Zanzibar revolution. Ms Ali said, “This is another opportunity for entrepreneurs, business people, farmers, service providers from both private and public sectors to show, display, and sell their products. I ask the media to help us spread the news.” The theme of the 2020 Mapinduzi Trade fair is “Industrial Development opens doors to employment for youths,” and the minister said that the planned fair will also include special days for exhibition of particular products such as ‘Seaweed Day’, ‘New commodities and Crops Day’, ‘Entrepreneurs Day’, and ‘Business clinic’.
