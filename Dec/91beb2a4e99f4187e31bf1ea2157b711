NMB bank yesterday awarded smart phones, helmets and reflectors to its best QR Code users in the bodaboda pool at a ceremony, which some of them attended under the chairmanship of their umbrella outfit. Handing over the prizes, NMB Senior Manager Card Operations and Finance, Lupia Mashauri, said the bank would always endeavour to provide financial inclusivity, education and support in the industry that employs thousands of youth in the country. Elaborating, he noted that those awarded had been making remarkable transactions by being paid their due fares by their passengers through their NMB bank personal accounts. “We have what is called MasterCard QR Code system which every registered bodaboda has in his/her reflector and a Merchant ID number, which a passenger scans with his/her smartphone to pay,” he pointed out. Mr Mashauri further noted that the system saves a bodaboda rider from hustling to look for loose money as change to pay back to a passenger who has a big money denomination. “It remits money straight to the account of the bodaboda rider, and here anyone who has made over 200 transactions according to our three set stages gets an award. But, in January next year, if one would climb to over 600 transactions, would be awarded a new boxer motorcycle,” he added. On his part, the Chairman of the Bodaboda Riders Association in Dar es Salaam, Mr Michael Massawe, said that the bank had partnered with them to the extent that majority of them were now capable of eking out a living in a decent way.
