Tanzania Taekwondo Federation’s secretary general Shija Shija said the tournament was essentially aimed at bringing together martial artists from Eastern African region so that they may learn from each other. "We also intend to use it as the platform to recruit new talented players as well as promote martial arts skills," he stated. Shija used the occasion to encourage Tanzanians to join taekwondo training because it is very useful in selfdefence and discipline. Korean envoy to Tanzania, Ambassador Tae-Ick Cho, said this is the second time his office supported Taekwondo championship, adding that it was a traditional form of sport in the Republic of Korea.
