SONGAS has invested over 63m/- in two health and education initiatives, in a move to support the government’s efforts to achieve the Development Vision 2025. The company handed over 8 classrooms at Ubungo Kisiwani Primary School in Dar es Salaam early this week, cementing its position as a committed partner to advancing education in Tanzania. According to the statement released by the company, the construction of the learning facilities commenced in May this year at a total cost of 47m/-and are set to serve more than 1200 pupils. The classrooms are expected to cover the huge influx of students enrolled at the school resulting from the government’s free education policy. Speaking during the brief handover event, the school’s headmistress Ms Sarah Muna said: “The support by Songas will go a long way in making the teaching and learning environment more conducive for both our teachers and pupils. We sincerely appreciate the company’s valuable support.” The company has also donated 16m/-to Tumaini la Maisha (TLM), a local NGO working under the Muhimbili National Referral Hospital in delivering pediatric oncology health care for children in Tanzania. The funds will be used to repair and supply equipment at the hospital’s phlebotomy and cannulation rooms. The support is expected to benefit over 500 children per year at the national cancer treatment facility. Songas employees also donated TZS1.75 million through individual contributions to purchase drinking water bottles/containers for child patients at the hospital. Speaking on the recent donations, Songas Managing Director, Nigel Whittaker said: “As a partner to Tanzania, our recent support in health and education sectors aim at complementing government’s efforts to build thriving communities and support the country’s Five-Year Development Plan and Development Vision 2025.”
