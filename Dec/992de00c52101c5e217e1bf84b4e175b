THE Government has ordered the Babati Town Council in Manyara Region to give the National Food Reserve Agency (NFRA) the right of ownership of a plot where it intends to construct a warehouse. The Deputy Minister for Agriculture, Mr Omary Mgumba, who was inspecting the warehouse construction in the district recently, told the council to do so as soon as possible. He also directed the council to apply for power connection to the area from the Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO). "Delay of issuance of the title deed to NFRA, would translate into loss of a source of income. Do that as quickly as possible so that they pay tax and the government gets its dividend," said Mr Mgumba. Earlier on, the NFRA Northern Zone Acting Manager, Mr Yohana Mfinanga, explained to the minister that they had to suspend construction on plots that they were told had been earmarked for TANESCO high voltage lines, and shift elsewhere, incurring incur more costs as a consequence. The project is being implemented at Maisaka Katani, with plots being purchase at a cost of 300m/-from the Babati Town Council. Mr Mfinanga said that the project was being implemented through a soft loan from the Polish government to the tune of 18.59bn/-. Tanzania Building Agency (TBA) is the project supervisor. Mr Mfinanga noted that the warehouse capacity of the NFRA Arusha Zone covering Arusha, Kilimanjaro and Manyara regions after completion of the new one will be 79,000 tons.
