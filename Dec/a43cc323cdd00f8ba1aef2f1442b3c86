THE government in Dodoma has commended local construction firms for being proactive in the construction of roads and bridges, urging them to create more job opportunities. Speaking after the inspection of the construction of roads and bridges, Dodoma Regional Commissioner, Dr Binilith Mahenge, said the constructor had shown the capacity to deliver. During his tour of Kongwa, Dr Mahenge said he was impressed with Tactics and Construction Company’s quality work as the work progress had reached 92 per cent. He said the constructed bridge was a vital to link communities in Mlali as the area was prone to floods. He urged Tanzania National Roads Agency (Tanroads) and Tanzania Rural and Urban Roads Agency (Tarura) to support such local contractors who showed commitment to delivering and creating jobs. Tactics and Construction Company engineer Thobias Kyando told the regional commissioner that the bridge was 51 metres long and would cost 2.19bn/-. He said the company expected to hand over the bridge by January 4 next year. “We are about to complete the work. We expect the road will be open for use next month,” he assured. Villagers praised the government for fulfilling its promise. Ms Prisca Mahimbi, an Ibwaga resident, told reporters during the rainy season communities couldn’t move from one area to another due to road network breakdown, but now they were able to move and access social services. “Everyone is happy with the construction progress. What we just need is the road to be opened ... This will be a solution to our long time problem,” she noted.
