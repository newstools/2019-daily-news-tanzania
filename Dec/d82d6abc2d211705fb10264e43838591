EDUCATION stakeholders are meeting in Dodoma for a three-day conference to discuss issues that affect the achievement of quality education in the country and collectively chart a way forward on how to address them. Among the key challenges to be discussed is implementation of inclusive education, especially for needy children and children with disabilities. Speaking on the sidelines of the conference, a representative of Sense International in Tanzania, Benjamin Khwele, said education was the right of every child and that children with disabilities need to be given teachers who would assist them while at schools. The 11 Annual Quality Education Conference (QEC) in collaboration with Tanzania Education Network (TEN/ MET) gathered stakeholders to discuss such issues and come up with deliberations that would help the government and other partners in ensuring that the education sector continued growing. Themed ‘Quality Education, My Right’, the conference was officiated by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Dr Leonard Akwilapo. Speaking at the opening ceremony, Dr Akwilapo paid tribute to TEN/MET in supporting the country’s education sector, stressing that because of its contribution, the government was awaiting the deliberations that would come out of the conference, so that it could address the challenges that would be noted. Even as you continue with your efforts to improve the sector, still we are facing several challenges and I believe that your network in collaboration with scholars and other development partners will come up with recommendations that the government is ready to receive and address.
