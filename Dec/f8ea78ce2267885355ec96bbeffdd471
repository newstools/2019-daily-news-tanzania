THE government plans to set up Orthopaedic-related services at Kwangwa Referral Hospital in Mara region once the health facility’s construction is complete. Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa revealed this shortly after inspecting ongoing construction activities at the hospital on Saturday, saying the facility will be the second largest in Tanzania --after the Muhimbili Orthopaedic Institute (MOI). “The introduction of such a unit aims to put orthopaedic services closer to the citizens, especially those from Lake Zone regions who are currently getting the service at the Mwanzabased Bugando hospital which is apparently overwhelmed,” he said. The Premier noted that Kwangwa hospital is one of the strategic projects, being implemented by the government, adding President John Magufuli had directed the release of 15bn/-, for the project, which takes place after over 40 years of stagnation. Earlier, Mara Regional Commissioner Adam Malima presented that the hospital was expected to start offering the maternal and child health services by February next year. The RC said that referral services were expected to start in May next year, and specialised services to be offered before the end of next year. He praised the President’s granting of the requested amount sought to enable the revival of the referral hospital’s construction work.
