POLICE in Dar es Salaam Region has warned that it will deal firmly with anyone who would engage in unlawful acts leading to a breach of peace during the upcoming holiday season. The Dar es Salaam Special Zone Police Commander, Mr Lazaro Mambosasa, gave the warning during a media briefing session yesterday, urging the public to celebrate Christmas and New Year festivities peacefully. In ensuring that the city remains peaceful and in harmonious, the police, in collaboration with other security organs, will strengthen patrols at all public gatherings, including beaches, religious institutions as well as recreational centres. "Motorists should abide by road safety laws and regulations laws, which include avoiding to overload passengers, drink driving, speeding and engaging in chaos," said Mr Mambosasa. According to the commander, serious legal measures would be taken against those who would defy the orders. Meanwhile, Commander Mambosasa has maintained that the prohibition against the ban on installation of sirens on vehicles and motorcycles was intact, stressing that the law had specified the type of vehicles in which the gadgets can be installed. "Chapter 168 of the Road Traffic Act of 1973 as amended in the year 2002 under Section 39 B (1) and (2) has described the use of signals such as sirens, among others. "On the other hand, Section 54 (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) has specified the nature of the environment in which sirens can be installed and the parties required to have the gadgets installed on the vehicles," he noted. He revealed, however, that the law only requires emergency vehicles to install sirens, including the ones used in motorcades, security and law enforcement organs, ambulances and others that have been granted permits by the Minister for Home Affairs and gazetted in the Government General Notice.
