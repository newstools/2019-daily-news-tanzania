IT was a unique alliance when the spokesperson of Simba SC, Haji Manara and former Young Africans midfielder, Ally Mayay placed their allegiance aside, while joining hands to train TMA Stars, the army team in Monduli, Arusha. The expert football personalities conducted the training for Tanzania Military Academy (TMA) Stars, team at the TMA army institution base. It was during an occasion to recognise the army team’s efforts for earning promotion from playing in District league to Regional level. The ceremony to award the TMA Stars team went hand in hand with the training seminar as well fundraising, to boost the army squad’s coffers. Manara and Mayay alias ‘Tembele’ donated 1m/-to the army team. “Mainland champions Simba SC will also support the TMA Stars in contributing another 1m/- but I will personally also bring sports equipment to the team,” said Manara, who also promised to organise some matches for Simba to play against the army team in future. On his part, Mayay promised to donate footballs to the TMA Stars and lauded the army team for such advancement. “The team has a promising future and as far as the army team is concerned, their projection is even more encouraging,” he stated. Earlier on the TMA Stars Chairperson, Major Humphrey Nyuchi said the team has 26 players, among them 16 ordinary citizens and the remaining ten are army officers from the Tanzania Peoples’ Defence Forces (TPDF). “The team which is in the top six slotting of the Arusha Regional League still faces a number of management issues, due to financial constraints,” said Nyuchi. The Acting Head of the Tanzania Military Academy, Brigadier General Ibrahim Michael Mhona, said the TMA has big plans for the army team; “We intend to make the TMA Stars the best team in the country,” he stated. Speaking at the event, the Monduli District Commissioner (DC), Idd Kimanta who led the fundraising exercise said they managed to raise 25m/-and thanked all the contributors.
