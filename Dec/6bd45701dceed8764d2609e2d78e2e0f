POLICE in Katavi region have arrested 11 people including Mlele District Council five workers for allegedly stealing Mlele District Hospital building materials valued at 14.9m/-. Revealing the arrest, Mlele District Commissioner (DC), Ms Recho Kasanda said the suspects would be charged for allegedly stealing bags of cement, wires, iron bars, and iron sheets and sabotaging the institution’s health facility construction. “I hereby order the Mlele District Council Procuring Officer ,Esau Nelle to refund the money earlier meant to procure the health centre’s construction materials, or else stern action including arrest should follow,” she said. The DC noted that such acts of stealing and laxity of the council to supervise the work have made the construction to stall; hence they have a case to answer.
