ALL of the East African Community (EAC)’s organs, institutions and projects have received an unqualified opinion from independent auditors’ judgment. The EAC Audit Commission, which met in Entebbe, Uganda, came out with the opinion that the financial statements of the six-country bloc are fairly and appropriately presented, without any identified exceptions and in compliance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The EAC Secretary General, Ambassador Liberat Mfumukeko, shared the good news on social media through his Twitter Account, disclosing that he had met the Commission. “We met in Entebbe with the EAC Audit Commission. For FY (Financial Year) 2018/2019, all EAC organs, institutions and projects got an unqualified clean) opinion. Good progress in the management of the Community is confirmed,” said the SG. An unqualified opinion is compared to a qualified opinion, in which the auditor has determined that there is a material issue with regard to accounting policies – but one that does not misrepresent the factual financial position. Qualified opinions may also be issued if the financial statements deviate from GAAP or have inadequate disclosure. If the financial statements have been truly misrepresented or misstated, the auditor might report an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion.
