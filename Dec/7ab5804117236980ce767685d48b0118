THE government, which has initiated legal aid for poor people residing in rural communities, has vowed to protect all paralegal personalities serving in remote areas. The Arusha Regional Community Development Officer, Blandina Nkini, who also serves as Deputy Registrar of Paralegals here, said her office was aware of the dangers faced by providers of legal aid when assisting poor communities and that they would direct local leaders to ensure that they were protected. A total of 75 new paralegals will be dispatched to provide legal services to Monduli, Karatu and Ngorongoro districts, targeting the mostly nomadic pastoralist communities. That follows the successful recruitment, training and empowerment of fresh, young legal assistants who will be expected to provide free law oriented advocacy services to rural communities, whose members can neither afford legal services nor understand them. “Yet these are the same people who suffer most when it comes to breached human rights, property loss, genderbased violence and crushed rights of children, precisely the girl child,” stated the Arusha Regional Community Development Officer, Blandina Nkini. She was speaking at the climax of one of such paralegal training and empowerment sessions organized by the Tanzania Pastoralists Community Forum (TPCF) and used the occasion to handle the working manifest and other paralegal tools to the new recruits that will be dispatched to serve the communities of Karatu, Monduli and Ngorongoro districts. The Executive Director of Tanzania Pastoralists Community Forum (TPCF), Joseph Ole Parsambei, explained that a total of 25 paralegal service providers will be dispatched to each of the three districts. “These are going to fill the vacuums left by dropouts who left the services either after migrating to other regions, sickness, deaths or change in profession,” stated Parsambei, adding that the TPCF had been running the special fiveyear program focused on the recruitment, training as well as empowerment of young paralegals. “We mostly support nomadic pastoralist communities that usually face problems of land rights, human rights, women and children abuse, as well as good governance; a challenging task because even the beneficiaries themselves can turn out to be hostile,” he pointed out.
