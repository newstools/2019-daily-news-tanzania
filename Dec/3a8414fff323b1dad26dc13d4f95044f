MAINLAND side, Kilimanjaro Stars will be out to make positive start at the 2019 CECAFA Senior Challenge Cup as they entertain Kenya Harambee Stars in Kampala, Uganda today. It will be the second match in group B of which, the opening game will see Zanzibar taking on Sudan in yet another big clash of the day. Defeating Kenya, who are the defending champions will be a big plus to the country’s envoys who are seeking to win the title for the fourth time. The last time Kilimanjaro Stars won the competition was in 2010 after a 1-0 win over guest team Ivory Coast at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam via a spot kick, which was expertly converted by Shadrack Nsajigwa. With that memory still afresh, the country’s flag bearers have another opportunity to make it big by bringing home the silverware from the foreign territory. On the other hand, Kenya lifted it in 2017 following a 3-2 penalty victory over Zanzibar in a thrilling final, which ended 2-2 in normal play hence forcing spot kicks to separate the two sides. The two 2017 CECAFA finalists (Kenya and Zanzibar) have since been packed in the same group B and will revive their previous rivalry on Tuesday. However, on several occasion, Kilimanjaro Stars Head Coach Juma Mgunda has been praising the current group of his players, saying they are cable to do wonders in Uganda. “We have had good preparations both in Tanzania and here in Uganda and the chances for us to do better here are very big even though it will not be that easy,” Mgunda said in a telephone interview from Uganda. He added that his boys have already adapted to the Uganda weather which he said is also a good gesture showing that they can really do a great job worth recognition. “The other area we have succeeded to work on is about psychology of players and we have reminded them about what they are here for. We have been regularly reminding them that we are here to compete and win matches,” he said
