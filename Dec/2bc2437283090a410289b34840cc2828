THE Tanzania Truck Owners Association (TATOA) has expressed full support to the re-establishment of Dar es Salaam-Tanga- Kilimanjaro railway services, saying it will stimulate the growth of the transportation sector. They said the cargo train will facilitate and smoothen cargo transportation from Dar es Salaam to Kilimanjaro and viceversa. Deputy Tatoa chairperson Ms Angelina Ngalula told th ‘Daily news’ that the association was delighted by the resumption of the train services, pledging that they would give the government full support. She was speaking to reporters after sketching a briefing on the relationship between the Tanzanian based ‘MFK’ Company and the Chinese cargo company, ‘Hongyan’. She said Tatoa would be ferrying cargo from train stations to other destinations and that trucks would always be needed to ferry cargo to destinations not covered by trains. The Tatoa boss added that the association was also focusing on offering services to neighbouring countries. She said: “Some countries such as Zambia and Malawi hire trucks from South Africa; we are doing everything in our capacity to tap such opportunities.” The MFK Automobile Tanzania Managing Director, Ali Jawad Karmal, said given the cooperation with the Chinese company, Tanzania would be able to supply spare parts to all parts of the country and neighbouring ones.
