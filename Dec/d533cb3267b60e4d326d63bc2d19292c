PERMANENT Secretary (PS) in the Ministry of Agriculture Mathew Mtigumwe has given a three-month ultimatum to contractors commissioned to construct an irrigation scheme to expand a rice production (ERPP) project to complete the job or lose benefits. The PS issued the directives at the weekend during a review session of the World Bank-supported irrigation schemes and warehouses held at the ministryâ€™s office in Dodoma. He wanted project coordinator January Kayumbe not to go for the festive season and ensure the irrigation scheme was completed by April next year. The PS named the contractor lagging behind as Lukolo Construction Company Ltd working on Msimba Seed Farm, a 640-hectare owned by Agricultural Seed Agency (ASA). The list also includes Confits Company Ltd that runs Msola Ujamaa Irrigation Scheme in Kilombero District and Goba Construction Ltd working on Mgugu I in Mvomero District in Morogoro Region. The two companies had only completed work by 25 and 29 per cent respectively. Mr Mtigumwe said most rice farmers were aware of modern farming technology and needed government support to boost production and productivity. The Expand Rice Production Project seeks to increase rice production from 1.8 tonnes in 2015/16 to 6 tonnes in 2018/19 per hectare. World Bank strategic agricultural issues specialist for East and Southern Africa Region Holger Kray asked the ministry to monitor irrigation scheme contractors so that they could complete the projects on time to enable more farmers to benefit from them and increase production and household incomes. The ERPP was implemented in 2015/16 and about $22.9m was set aside for its implementation in Mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar.
