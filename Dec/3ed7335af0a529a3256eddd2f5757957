TTCL mobile network subscribers will enjoy free movies and other forms of entertainment in the coming seasons after the company launched a free movies access application dubbed T-Burudani. Films which will be freely available for the subscribers includes Tanzanian movies and comedies famously known as Bongo movies, Bollywood, Hollywood, Nollywood and there is no need for internet bundles for customers to access the entertainment. “Free movies entertainment access is a gift to our loyal customers during the end of the year seasons. It will be available after one installs T-Burudani Application from Google play store and upper store in the smart phones,” said TTCL Corporation’s Chief Executive officer Waziri Kindamba as he introduced T-Burudani App in Dar es Salaam on Thursday. Kindamba said customers will continue to access the entertainment movie of their choice at lower price after the seasonal periods are over. Kindamba will also lead regional managers and heads of departments to help current and prospective customers to accomplish biometric registration of simcards before set deadline expires so that they access network and get entertainment unhindered. “We don’t want our customers to be left out or get any disturbance in enjoying the entertainment. All TTCL shops will remain open seven days a week for 12 hours each day, and will be open in Christmas days to ensure that registration is done to allow the entertainment to be enjoyed.”
