SERENGETI Breweries Limited (SBL) Thursday said will develop and maintain highly productive workforce as key prerequisite in realising its growth and contribution to the economy. The SBL Corporate Relations Director, Mr John Wanyancha said the brewer employs around 800 employees both directly and indirectly in its breweries while also economically supporting thousands others across its value chain. “Our vision to remain an employer of choice, keeps us continuously focused on our employees’ welfare, which we believe is as a key prerequisite to developing and maintaining a highly productive work force,” Wanyancha said after holding end of the-year parties to its employees across in Mwanza, Dar and Moshi plants. According to the corporate relations director, SBL also supports local farmers to grow raw materials that the company uses in beer production including barley, maize and sorghum. Farmers receive free seeds from the company, field technical support as well as links to financial institutions for loans needed to commercialize their farming activities. In 2018, he said, SBL sourced about 17,000 metric tonnes of grains from the local farmers, which was equivalent to 70 per cent of total raw material requirement during the year. The grains were sourced from an existing network of 400 farmers which the brewer is keen to continue expanding. The producer of Tanzania’s first 100 per cent malt beer, Serengeti Premium Lager, the brewer is also home to renown international premium spirits such as Johnnie Walker, Ciroc, Smirnoff Vodka, White Horse, J& Bamong others.
