THE current account deficit narrowed to 1,842.1 million US dollars during the year ending October from a deficit of 1,993.0 million US dollars in the corresponding period last year, on account of an increase in the value of exports. The Bank of Tanzania (BoT) monthly economic review for November shows that much of the deficit in the current account was financed through external borrowing and foreign direct investment inflows. This development resulted into improvement of the overall balance of payments to a surplus of 292.9 million US dollars in the year under review from a deficit of 171.6 million US dollars a year earlier. The value of goods and services exports grew by 10.3 per cent to 9,472.3 million US dollars in the year ending October driven by service receipts and non-traditional goods exports. The value of non-traditional goods exports increased to 4,189.4 million US dollars in the year ending October from 3,048.3 million US dollars in the corresponding period 2018.

Similarly, the value of manufactured goods exports increased by 41.0 per cent to 1,068.1 million US dollars driven by iron and steel products, glass and glassware, manufactured tobacco and fertilizers.

The increase in export values for coffee and tea was largely on account of higher volumes following good weather during the crop season.
