DESPITE a significant rise in market activities, the Tanzania Share Index (TSI) remained stagnant during the week that ended on 06th December 2019. TSI closed the week at 3,431.10 points similar to the previous week. Correspondingly, the domestic market capitalization remained at TZS 9,010.58bln ($3.92bln). On the other hand, the All Share Index (DSEI) gained 11.57 points following a 0.57% appreciation of the total market capitalization to TZS 16,924.72bln ($7.36bln). The DSEI closed the week at 2,038.52 points from the previous weekâ€™s 2,026.95 points. The rally on the total market capitalization was highly influenced by the price appreciation of Kenya Commercial Bank (DSE: KCB). The price of KCB, along with most listed Kenyan banks, has been on the rise in the recent past due to the revocation of the interest rate cap by the parliament during October. KCB gained 2.68%, followed by East African Breweries Ltd (DSE: EABL) which grew by 0.94%. Jubilee Holdings Ltd (DSE: JHL) was also on the green, jumping by 0.64%. Kenya Airways (DSE: KA) maintained its bearish trend after diminishing by 9%. KA was the only counter on the red. National Media Group (DSE: NMG) and Uchumi Supermarket Ltd (DSE: USL) remained unchanged. Total equity turnover during the week under review grew by 164% thanks to increased activities on the TBL counter. Total equity turnover during the week was TZS 9.07bln ($3.94mln) realized through trading a volume of 3.4mln shares. This was way high compared to the previous week which saw a turnover of TZS 3.4bln ($1.49mln). Tanzania Breweries Ltd (DSE: TBL) retained its glory after emerging as the top mover, snatching the title from CRDB after two weeks of reign. TBL commanded 97% of the total turnover while moving only 32% of the volume traded. Most of the activities on the TBL counter was foreign-dominated. Foreign investors dominated market activities during the week but remained net sellers. Foreign investment accounted for 91% of the total investment while foreign divestment accounted for 98.8% of the total divestments. The net foreign outflow totaled to TZS 680.7mln ($0.296mln). Money Market, Bills and Bonds The Interbank Money Market (IMM) reported a 62% growth in transactions week on week. The total value traded on the IMM during the week was TZS 60.7bln ($26.4mln) compared to TZS 37.5bln ($16.3mln) traded during the previous week. Interbank rate gained 24bps to a weighted average interbank rate of 4.88% at the end of the week. In an unusual tendency, at least following the recent interest in long term Treasury securities, the 15 years Treasury bond was undersubscribed during the auction that was held on 04th December 2019. The lesser appetite for the instrument is seen as the excitement for the next 20 years Treasury bond to be auctioned on 18th December 2019. The Bank of Tanzania, on behalf of the government, offered a 15 years Treasury bond worth TZS 109.2bln ($47.47mln). The market tendered a total of TZS 102.15bln ($44.4mln) in 70 bids, marking an under subscription rate of 6.46%. The Bank accepted 64 bids worth TZS 97.99bln ($42.6mln). Similar to the recent trend, the weighted average yield to maturity (WAYTM) for the instrument dropped by 13bps to 15.24%.
