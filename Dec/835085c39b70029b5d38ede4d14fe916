AFTER massive investment in air transportation made by the government, Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority (TCAA) says it was now persuading secondary and primary school students to pursue courses that would enable them grab opportunities in the aviation sector. TCAA’s Acting Director General, Mr Valery Chamulungu, said that the revival of the national flag carrier, Air Tanzania Company Limited, expansion of different airports and installation of four modern surveillance radar at different airports were creating more job opportunities which await Tanzanian youth. “The aviation sector is growing with numerous jobs opportunities like pilots, engineers, airport marshal’s, air hostess being created. TCAA is making deliberate efforts to reach students in various parts of the country to expose them to all matters related to the aviation sector and its economic potentiality so that they can prepare and study courses related to this sector,” the Acting Director said as he officiated the World Civil Aviation Day in Dar es Salaam yesterday. He added that to succeed in the mission, TCAA, through the consumers consultative council, had already opened clubs in Dar es salam, Arusha, Kilimanjaro and Mtwara regions and nearly two thousand students have been equipped with aviation awareness and needed skills to benefit from raising opportunities. Meanwhile, the acting director general said that installing surveillance radar work was done at Julius Nyerere and Kilimanjaro international airports, while Mwanza Airport had also been installed but awaits completion of the office building construction being carried out by the Tanzania Airport Authority (TAA) before the radar can be switched on.
