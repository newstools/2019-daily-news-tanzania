GEITA District Commissioner (DC), Josephat Maganga has directed artisanal miners and mineral processors to observe safe use of chemicals, otherwise, they would face legal actions. Mr Maganga gave the directive on Thursday on behalf of Geita Regional Commissioner (RC), Robert Gabriel, at the climax of a training session for small miners on safe use of chemicals. The training was organised by the Government Chemist Laboratory Authority (GCLA) Lake Zone Office. "I believe that you have learnt a lot during two days of training so that when you resume your mining activities, you will implement them by action in order to protect public health and the environment," he said, adding: "If we discover that you are perpetrating misconduct in spite of being among the training’s beneficiaries, we will not hesitate to take legal measures against you." The district commissioner told the participants to be ambassadors of spreading the knowledge they had gained to colleagues who hadn’t had the chance to participate in the course that featured 78 participants. Earlier, Government Chief Chemist Dr Fidelice Mafumiko, said the authority would continue giving training to miners and also plans to open a new office in Geita, in order to draw services closer to the people.
