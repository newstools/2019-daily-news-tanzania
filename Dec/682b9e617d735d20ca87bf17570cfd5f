THE National Bank of Commerce (NBC) in collaboration with Tanzania Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (TCCIA) and the National Economic Empowerment Council (NEEC) have helped entrepreneurs in Dodoma to establish a Business Club that would help them acquire skills on how to run their businesses professionally. The club according to the bank’s head of SMEs and Retail Banking, Evance Luhimbo will help the traders to overcome challenges they face in their businesses and improve. “The world is now changing and expanding that is why NBC is now trying to train you to cope with the changes and technologies, which go along with them. It is because we want our customers to intensify networking between small, medium and large businesspeople in the country,’’ said Mr Luhimbo. The banker noted that such clubs had been established in some five regions and showed positive results in their communities especially amongst the businesspeople. In response NEEC representative, Nyakaho Mahemba, said her council was duty bound to coordinate entrepreneurship programmes countywide, adding that networking in entrepreneurship is important. On his part, TCCIA Manager for Industries and Development, Patrick Magai said his authority was also coordinating such training especially on taxes to seal loopholes, which some traders exploit to avoid paying taxes. “We have also been talking to the businesspeople going outside to countries like China to have a culture of paying taxes, because it is what has helped them to succeed in their businesses,” he said.
