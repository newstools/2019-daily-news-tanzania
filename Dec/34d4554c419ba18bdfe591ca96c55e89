THE Deputy Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Hamad Yussuf Masauni, came down hard on Regional Police Commanders (RPCs) in Pemba for their alleged failure to enforce laws and ineptness in the construction of police quarters in Pemba. Speaking at Ziwani Police quarters here, he expressed disappointment over failure by North Pemba RPC, Shekhan Mohamed Shekhan and South Pemba’s Hassan Nassir Ali to stop banned public rallies and demonstrations. “The government imposed an indefinite ban on political rallies and demonstrations, but this has been going in Pemba, Why? We are unhappy and I am therefore directing the Inspector General of Police to revoke their positions as RPCs,” Mr Masauni said. It said that the ACT-Wazalendo chief advisor, Mr Maalim Seif Sharif Hamad has been going on with rallies in Pemba Island, to strengthen the party and the country start preparations for the 2020 general elections. The Deputy Home affairs Minister also expressed unhappiness with the ongoing construction of police residential houses in Pemba, “The pace of the work is slow, in spite of the government allocation of enough funds for the project. This indicates that the RPCs are weak in making followups.”
