PRELIMINARY investigation has shown that what occurred at Tatwe Village in Rorya District recently was not a volcanic eruption, the Geological Survey of Tanzania (GST) has said. GST Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Dr Mussa Budeba, told reporters in Musoma on Thursday that the village was hit by a landslide. "I have visited Tatwe Village together with my team from GST. What happened was not a volcanic eruption. It was a landslide," he insisted. The GST CEO said they responded as soon as a report on the incident went viral on social and in the mainstream media. He was speaking at the annual general meeting of a Mara press club held at Matvilla Beach Hotel. Mara Regional Commissioner (RC) Adam Malima urged reporters to be careful when reporting sensitive issues that triggered panic and tension in society by crosschecking the facts with the relevant authorities. The Mara RC, who was the guest of honour at the meeting, said he was ready and would collaborate with reporters to bring about development in the region. "I need the media for development of Mara Region. You need to be part of the development process of Mara," Mr Malima said. Meanwhile, the RC said he had formed a special team to investigate the misuse of millions of shillings provided by the fifth phase government to construct a public hospital in Bunda District.
