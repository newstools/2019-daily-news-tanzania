It was the first match of this year’s 4th edition of China Construction Association Inter-sports games which has drawn 12 Chinese companies working in the country under one roof with its climax expected on December 17th. It is a contest which brings together various construction companies from China, which are working in the country for the purpose to enhance their cooperation and improve their health. Briefing the media yesterday here, Coordinator of the event Wen Ju said the competition is specifically organised to accelerate good cooperation among themselves. “As you know, sports are a very important thing which helps a lot to unite people, this is why we usually organise this event,” Ju said. He further pointed out that it gives them a good platform to socialise with others after spending the whole year busy working on various development projects.
