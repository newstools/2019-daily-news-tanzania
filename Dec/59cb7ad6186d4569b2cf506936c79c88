THE Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) plans to embark on a special programme to raise awareness amongst members of the public on all forms of corruption. Head of Public Sector of PCCB Mr Asseri Mandari, made the revelation here over the weekend, noting that the main goal of the programme is to encourage corruption victims to report cases of the vice to security organs. “I urge all members of the public to play their part in combating corruption because combating corruption is everyone’s duty,” said the senior PCCB official in an address to University of Dodoma (UDOM) students at the weekend. The event was jointly organised by Tanzania Gender Networking Programme (TGNP) and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences (CHSS) during the ongoing 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence. Mr Mandari said that so far, 58,059 cases of corruption had been reported to gender desks at police stations since the government established them, pointing out these included rape and beating women and girls. “Gender desks have increased the level of awareness on corruption to members of the public and encourage them to report corruption cases,” he said. Vice Guild President of CHSS, Rose Paul, expressed gratitude to TGNP for organising the event to raise awareness on corruption, urging the non-governmental organisation to conduct such events for students regularly, to raise their awareness on the vice. “This will encourage more students to be open and report corruption cases to security organs,” she said
