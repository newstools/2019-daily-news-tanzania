FOUR residents of Zanzibar, who were charged with an economic sabotage case involving elephant tusks, on Friday benefited from presidential amnesty having been freed from prison after paying a minimal amount of 15m/-for poaching. Before the Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court in Dar es Salaam, the beneficiaries were Selemani Msomi (47), Filo B akari (38), Kizito Paul (45) and Rashid Ally (30). They had been charged with three different offences relating to unlawful possession of pieces of elephant tusks, which are government trophies. However, acting on the presidential amnesty granted by President John Magufuli, the four wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), expressing their intention to enter into a plea bargaining agreement. The DPP accepted their respective letters and decided to charge them with one count of poaching. State Attorney Elizebeth Mkunde presented the new charge before the court against the accused persons. All accused person admitted both the charge and the memorandum of facts presented before Resident Magistrate Vick Mwaikambo. The magistrate, thereafter, convicted them on their own plea of guilty. Furthermore, the magistrate registered the plea bargaining agreement entered by both parties (prosecution and defence) in order to end the trial. Among the conditions in the agreement requires the accused pay 15m/-as compensation to the government. Apart from directing the accused persons to comply with the terms and condition of the agreement they signed, the magistrate also sentenced each of them to either pay 500,000/- as a fine or go to jail for six months in default of paying the fine in question. Reading the new charge, the trial attorney told the court that between January 1 and October 2, 2017 at Mpoande Reserve Area in Dar es Salaam, jointly and together, all accused persons were found in possession of four pieces of elephant tusks without having any permit from the Director of W ildlife.
