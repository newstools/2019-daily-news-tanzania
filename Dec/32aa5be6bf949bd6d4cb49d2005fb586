SECONDARY school students in the country have asked the government to prohibit corporal punishment, hinting that it is detrimental to their learning process. They came with such a request during a dialogue forum on the promotion of a safe leaning process in secondary schools as part of marking 16 days of activism to end gender-based violence (GBV). The dialogue was organised jointly by Women in Law and Development (Africa), WilDAF and Vijana Pambana Pata Maendeleo Rukwa (Vipamaru) under the sponsorship of Freedom House and Pact. The aim of the dialogue, according to WiLDAF Advocacy Officer Neema Meremo, was to create awareness on the importance of 16 days to discuss alternative punishment as a strategy to enhance teachers’ skills to instil positive discipline in students. Meremo said also they had discussed about factors which would promote protective skills to ensure students remained safe at school and understood theirrights. Maliki Abdulrahman of Tandika Secondary School said some teachers punished them, but that was not the way to encourage them to attend school as feared that they would be punished. She advised that when students made mistakes teachers should sit down with them and understand why they had behaved in that way and find an alternative way of moulding their behaviour instead of using corporal punishment as the only way to discipline them. Mwanaidi Fais of Makumbusho said corporal punishment was not a solution to enable students to change behaviour instead teachers should learn how best they could do to control students without using corporal punishment whenever they misbehaved or made mistakes. “It is true that there are circumstances when students seem to be stubborn in class or at school, but when it comes to punishment we don’t support that because there are some teachers who would beat a student as if they are beating a bandit,” he said.
