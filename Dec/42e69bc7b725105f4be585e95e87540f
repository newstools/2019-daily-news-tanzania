THE Same based Same Kaya Savings and Credit Society (Same Kaya Saccos) in Kilimanjaro Region has expanded its geographical boundaries of operation by opening a new branch in Ndungu area, within the district. This was revealed by the Same Kaya Saccos Chairman Mr Elibariki Kisimbo, when briefing the Chairman of the Tanzania Co-operative Development Commission (TCDC) Dr Titus Kamani, who visited the Saccos’ Headquarters, recently. “The new centre is the addition of another one which was opened in Hedaru area with the intentions meant to enable our members who are very far from our head office to avail themselves of the Saccos services. “Many people, especially those residing from rural areas, do not get the Saccos and other financial related services due to the fact that there are no financial institutions close to where they stay, therefore this branch at Ndungu is meant to help them access the services,” he said. Speaking during the visit, Dr Kamani hailed Same Kaya Saccos for its good services it provides as well as its strategies, a move which he said was the main reason for the number of its members to increase every year. “Many people would like to join a co-operative society which has good management, yours is an example to be reckoning with, may I take this opportunity to urge those who haven’t join the Same Kaya Saccos to do so as to benefit with opportunities which are available here,” he said. Earlier on the Same Kaya Saccos General Manager, Ms Elvera Mdee, told the Dr Kamani that the number of the Saccos’ member had risen from 73 in 2002, with a capital of 463,000/- to the current 5,300 members, as well as a special children account which has 26 clients. “Shares are now worth 176m/-, whereby savings, special savings and deposits have collective worthiness amounting to 1.8bn/-. “The future as far as the institution is concerned is better because of the new branch in Ndungu area, because it will make the members of the Saccos and the new potential members in the area to do away with lack of financial services that used to act as barrier against people who needed them”, she said.
