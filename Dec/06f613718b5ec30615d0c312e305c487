SOMALIANS are set to benefit more in economic activity through fishing after being trained by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in collaboration with the Fisheries Education and Training Agency (FETA). JICA and FETA conducted training for trainers’ programme of Somalis from different fisheries institutions in Somalia. The trainees had two training workshops-the first was conducted in 2016 and the second was conducted this year. According to a media statement issued yesterday among the targets set during this training include creating more jobs by building the capacity of Somalis, especially the youth involved in the fisheries sector. Moreover, the goal of such training is to improve people’s livelihoods through fisheries development in the country. The training workshops have brought a lot of benefits to 35 Somalis who have now fishing skills they would not have attained due to political instability in their country. In addition, the statement notes that FETA can use a boat to deploy fish aggregating devices (FADs) in the Indian Ocean to improve productivity that will attract high value fish to enable smallscale fishermen to access the untapped fish at affordable costs. Many countries in the world apply this technique to boost their economic gains from underexploited fishery resources. The overarching goal of JICA, in this context, is to contribute to the government’s effort towards commercialisation of marine fisheries for increased productivity resulting in improved livelihoods and food security.
