IN commemorating 40 years since establishment of the Pan African Postal Union (PAPU ), the Tanzania Postal corporation (TPC) has launched a competition for journalists which aims to create more awareness to Tanzanians on postal activities. " Practicing Tanzanian journalists and those who are still in colleges are welcomed to present their submissions in a feature article, explaining the importance of physical address and post-code in building an industrialised Tanzania," the Acting Postmaster General, Ms Mwanaisha Said, told reporters in Dar es Salaam yesterday. She said that the aim of focusing on journalists in the competition was to create more awareness to the general public through media personalities on the role of postal services in the envisaged middle economy country by 2025 through sending and receiving letters, parcels and electronic finance services. Ms Said further revealed that a feature article which must be between 1,000 and 2,000 words long, will see the first three winning entries read before the guest of honor who is expected to be President John Magufuli during the commemoration of 4 0 years since establishment of PAPU on January 18, 2020 in Arusha where it is headquartered. She said that the gifts which will be presented to the 10 best winning articles will include laptop, Smartphone digital camera and certificate of participation. "All entries are to be typed, in Tahoma word format with 12 font size. December 31 will be the deadline for receiving the work," she added. She said that PAPU â€™s commemoration of 40 years will go in hand with that of 25 years since establishment of the Tanzania Postal Corporation.
