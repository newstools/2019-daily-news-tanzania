TANZANIA Communication Regulatory Authority (TCRA) has launched special campaign in Mtwara Region to encourage citizens to complete Sim-Card registration before end of month. Through the campaign dubbed ‘Nobody will be left behind, complete your SimCard registration’ is executed by mobile phone operators under TCRA supervision and financed by the Financial Sector Deepening Trust (FSDT). The Coastal Zone TCRA representative, V iolet Essoko said in Mtwara on Wednesday that the authority has worked on the challenges making more people to delay registering their SimCards on time. She said despite of the various campaigns sensitising people to register their SimCards, most people were still lag behind getting National Identification cards which is the prerequisite in completing registration. She said youth are among those not taking the SimCard registration exercise seriously compared to adults flocking in huge numbers to acquire the national identification cards for completing SimCard registration. In another development, some Mtwara residents have requested National Identification Authority (NIDA) to increase the number of its officials in order to speed up the processing of providing the national ID Cards. Mtwara residents said they have been using long time in the queue in order to acquire the national ID cards, the time that could be used for other economic activities. They said the delay in providing the national ID cards is also causing the exercise of SimCard registration to take long time to be completed. Mtwara District Commissioner (DC), Evodi Mmanda said at the launch of the weeklong campaign that citizens should take it seriously in order to complete their SimCard registration on time.
