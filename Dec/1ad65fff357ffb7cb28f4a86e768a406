DEPUTY Minister for Education, Science and Technology William Ole Nasha on behalf of the minister, Prof Joyce Ndalichako, on Friday laid the foundation stone for the Centre of Excellence in Leather Products and Allied Technologies (CELPAT) Project worth 37bn/- at Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology (DIT) - Mwanza Campus. The project aims at improving leather products. The event took place during DIT Mwanza Campus’ first graduation ceremony. According to the minister’s speech, the centre, whose construction is set to take off next month, is expected to be in full use in 2024 and will have the capacity to accommodate 1,200 students from the current number of 150. Prof Ndalichako urged the youth to study leather-related courses at the campus, saying one could become competent in leather processing in two months only and be self-employed. "The centre is sponsored by the World Bank to promote leather products in Tanzania. As a country, we are in a good position to do the best in the manufacture of high class leather products as we are the second in Africa for having a big number of livestock," the minister’s speech noted. She noted that decongesting DIT Mwanza Campus was part of the government's efforts to improve the sector of education, noting that 43 new vocational training centres worth 92bn/- were being constructed countrywide. According to the minister, through the government's free education initiative about 1tri/- has been released in the past four years, and 1.62tri/- more has been released for higher education loans since 2015 to 2019. "Thus, we believe that the completion of this centre will make the campus known in and outside Africa. I call on the youth to utilise this opportunity for the betterment of the youth and the nation. We are certain that they will be able to introduce factories and play part in industrialisation's goal as per this fifth phase government's ambition," the minister’s speech read by her deputy said.
