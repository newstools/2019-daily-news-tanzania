THE Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) in Dodoma is considering embarking on training in public schools and teachers’ tertiary institutions to fight against sexual extortion. It has so far launched strategies that include school and college anti-corruption clubs to unearth and fight against sexual corruption. PCCB Regional Commander Sosthenes Kibwengo said training teachers was a vital step towards addressing an upward trend in sex favours and sexual abuse in the workplace. “This helps teachers to understand their boundaries and enable students and pupils to defend their rights,” he said. “Training of teachers will go hand-in-hand with teaching students to discover and expose sexual corruption acts.” PCCB believes that the education is key to creating public awareness. Mr Kibwengo said one of the immediate indicators was to see a lot more cases being reported and action taken against the culprits. Cases of sexual extortion (also known as sex for grades) are increasing at an alarming rate not only in Tanzania, but also across the African continent. “We’re committed to fighting against this social phenomenon,” he emphasised. He said PCCB was also involved in a ‘break the silence’ campaign to make the youth wellinformed and be good ambassadors in society. He noted that platforms as school clubs would also be effectively used to spread the news about the campaign that sought to make anticorruption among the top agendas for individuals, institutions and communities
