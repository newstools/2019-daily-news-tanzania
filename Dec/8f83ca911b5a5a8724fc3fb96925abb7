CHRISTIANS in Tanzania today join others across the globe to celebrate Christmas, an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ. It is a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. But significantly, Christmas offers a unique opportunity for Christians and in fact other Tanzanians, to spend extra time together as a family, reconnect with their spouse, and create lasting holiday memories. Many people have taken time off from work just to ensure that they spend more time with their spouses and kids at home on this special day. Making holiday memories together is one simple way of strengthening the family life. Yes, holidays are ideal platforms to enjoy all our relationships. This should be one of the keystone messages during this festive period. Whether back in the village or in our urban setting, this holiday should be mainly about sitting down with our families and ensuring we create strong family bonds. It is of paramount importance that Tanzanians regardless of their faith make the most out of the break and do a lot of things that will bring our families closer together. A pep talk with our children, parents and in-laws could have huge positive impact in our endeavour to build strong families and eventually stronger nation. Christmas is not only an ideal time for family members to spend valuable time together but also to think of others. We should share the little we have got with the underprivileged ones-- a divine thing to do. As we celebrate Christmas we should also stay close to our Almighty by worshipping and praying for healthier family relationships. We should refrain from the perception that holidays are time for lavish spending. We must behave more responsibly and manage well the resources we have with a clear mind of what await us in January. Let us make good use of the holiday season to further strengthen our families. We all know that strong families are the backbone of a strong and prosperous nation.
