LOANS worth over 155m/-have been released to women and youth entrepreneur groups in the first quarter of the 2019/ 2020 financial year in Mkuranga District Council, being part of 500m/- allocated for the groups this year. District's Community Development Officer, Mr Peter Nambunga said in Mkuranga District on Friday during the signing of the loans contracts between the Council and the entrepreneurs, that the money was part of the 10 percent of the Council's collections to assist women, youth and groups of the disabled in the area. "Today we have disbursed over 155m/- to 10 youth groups and 17 women groups. We are expecting to give the remaining 2 percent of the money to the group of disabled after we have finalized the procedures," he noted. Mr Nambunga cautioned the groups which received the loans to spend the money as intended, saying that stern measures would be taken against those who would misuse the money. "Some people think that they can use the loan money in whichever way they wish. This time we are not going to tolerate such habits," he remarked.
