He carded 75, 79 and 78 in the day one, two and three respectively. “I tried my best but things did not work out as I expected. I dropped several shots today (yesterday) that could help me finish even better… things like this happen sometimes. “I respect and to some extent pleased with what I have achieved from this tournament. My opponents played better than I did,” said Mollel. Professional category was dominated by Kenyans, who took top two positions.
