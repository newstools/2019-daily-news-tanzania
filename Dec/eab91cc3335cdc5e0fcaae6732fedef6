TANZANIA Communication Regulatory Authority (TCRA) has urged citizens from the central zone regions to use efficiently the remaining time for Sim Card registration to avoid their mobile phones being switched off. This was said by the TCRA head of the central zone, Antonio Manyanda representing regions of Singida, Tabora, Dodoma, Katavi and Kigoma at the launch of a special campaign to make sure more people register their Sim Card on time. “The sensitization exercise to get more people registering their Sim Cards started in Dodoma then Singida before moving to Tabora,” he said adding that the public should make use of the time set by the government to register their Sim Cards or risk their mobile phones switched off. Since the Sim Cards registration was rolled out, only 17 million mobile phones users out of 30 million, have already registered their Sim Cards. He said the Sim Cards registration is being implemented at close collaboration with all mobile phones operators as well as the National Identification Authority (NIDA). Speaking at the launching event, Tabora Regional Commissioner, Aggrey Mwanri urged the citizens in the region to use the opportunity get their Sim Cards registered that goes hand in hand with the availability of National IDs. In another development, Mwanri ordered district executive directors, district commissioners and district administrative officers to take active part firing implementation of the Sim Card registration so that it may be successful. He said the region can only be successful in other development endeavours if the exercise of Sim Cards registration is completed on time. He called upon TCRA to provide the region with a coordinator to supervise the whole exercise so that it may meet the set up standards and deadline.
