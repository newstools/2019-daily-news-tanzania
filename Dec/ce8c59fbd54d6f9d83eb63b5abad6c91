MINISTER for Works, Transport and Communication, Isack Kamwelwe  said yesterday that the government is eying at improving marine transport in Lake Tanganyika. He said the next project will be in Lake Tanganyika after completing the ongoing project in Lake Victoria. President John Magufuli yesterday laid a foundation stone for reviving three vessels and construction of slipway at Mwanza South port in Mwanza region. The government through the Marine Services Company Limited (MSCL) has injected 152bn/-in the project. Mr Kamwelwe told the Head of State that the next plan is to make great improvement in water transport in Lake Tanganyika. “We are looking forward to do the same job in Lake Tanganyika after completing this project here in Lake Victoria. In Lake Nyasa, already three vessels have been built,” he noted. He said it is high time the Tanzanians make a proper use of its geographical position noting that the country is surrounded by water. He added that water and rail transport are cheaper compared to other means of transport and that improving them would stimulate economic growth in the country. According to Mr Kamwelwe, MV Umoja is one of vivid examples that stimulate economic growth. He said the vessels are recently expected to start shipping cement to Bukoba, Mara and Mwanza. “It is obvious that residents of the said regions will soon start to enjoy low price cement,” he noted. On his side, President Magufuli praised MSCL General Manager, Mr Eric Hamis saying he has so far recorded great success to the company. Apart from the improvement and constructions of vessels, the ministry has been able to renovate three ports.
