GWAMBINA FC Head Coach, Fulgence Novatus believes his side has potential to defeat Mashujaa FC in the First Division League (FDL) match set for Saturday at CCM-Lake Tanganyika Stadium in Kigoma. It will be a battle between the second-placed and third slot occupants respectively with each team eager to stamp a victory to continue climbing up the FDL ladders and currently, the two teams are separated by two points only in their group B category. Speaking during his team's training session yesterday at Gwambina Complex Stadium, Novatus said his charges are well prepared for the match and they target to win only. “I know that it will be a tough game since each of us is fighting for the victory but we have done our home work well to produce nothing short than a win in all our remaining fixtures,” said him. Adding, the former 977 KJ and Pamba SC player called upon the club’s passionate fans from Mwanza to continue supporting their team wholeheartedly in both home and away matches. On his part, Gwambina FC skipper Jacob Massawe promised that they will keep working hard to ensure that the team finishes top of their group B table so as to earn Mainland Premier League promotion next season.
