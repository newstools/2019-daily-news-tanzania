STATE Minister (Second Vice President’s Office), Mr Mohamed Aboud Mohamed, has unveiled a series of activities to be undertaken as part of the celebrations to mark the 56th anniversary of the revolution at Amani sports Stadium on January 12, 2020. The annual event to celebrate the revolution will end with a grand parade by security and defence forces, display of products and services by both private and public institutions, and a speech by President Ali Mohamed Shein. Mr Aboud issued a directive to both public and private institutions to decorate their offices and surrounding areas last Friday followed by hoisting of the national flag nationwide, “This will be followed by a health and fitness walk led by Dr Shein next Wednesday (January 01, 2020).” “We must keep our country clean to avoid contagious diseases like cholera. We should understand that good health is one of the objectives of the revolution,” Mr Aboud said as he appealed to members of the public to show-up in big numbers during all the planned activities. Opening or laying of foundation stones of development projects in Unguja and Pemba Island are the main activities to be presided over by Dr Shein, Union Vice President Ms Samia Suluhu Hassan, Zanzibar Second Vice President, Ambassador Seif Ali Iddi, Speaker of the House, Mr Zubeir Ali Maulid, and ministers from both Zanzibar and Union government. The celebrations will also be marked by fireworks (Fashifashi) display by the Tanzania People’s Defence Forces (TPDF) at Maisara ground (Unguja), and Tibirinzi (Chakechake Pemba) at midnight on January 11, 2020. The 56th anniversary of the Zanzibar revolution will be the last for Dr Shein to address as the President of Zanzibar. He constitutionally retires in the next general elections, paving way for his successor to take over.
