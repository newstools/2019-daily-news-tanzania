THE Tanzania Agricultural Development Bank (TADB) has handed over the riceharvesting machine to the member of Uwale Amcos in Simanjiro district, Manyara region. The event, which took place at Lemkuna village located in Ngorika ward, was graced by the District Commissioner Zephania Chaula and attended by the Assistant Registrar of Cooperative Unions Mr Venance Msafiri, villagers and farmers of Lemkuna village. TADB was represented by acting Central Zone Manager Mr Zakayo Mphuru. The small-scale rice farmers of Uwale AMCOs secured a 70m/- loan to procure a combined harvester from the bank. Prior to that, small-scale farmers had to harvest rice manually which was costly and with low efficiency. Speaking on behalf of Uwale members, Chairman of UWALE AMCOs Mr Stanley Msuya said that they are grateful for the loan which will increase farm productivities and raise their income. TADBâ€™s Representative Mr Zakayo Mphuru said other farmers should emulate Uwale Amcos and use machines that guarantee productivity. Simanjiro District Commissioner, Zephania Chaula, encouraged small-scale farmers of the Amcos to establish rice-processing plants in order to increase local and international market.
