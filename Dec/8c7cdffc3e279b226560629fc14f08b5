VODACOM Tanzania is set to enhance digital landscape by connecting more people get access to internet and online media through ‘smart kitochi’ smartphone offer during festive season. Vodacom’s Head of Sales and Distribution, George Lugata said that the move will help get more Tanzanians engaged on the digital landscape as part of the company’s digital drive to get more people access the internet and online media through the country’s fastest and most reliable Supa network infrastructure. “With a vision to take Tanzania unto the digital age, Vodacom Tanzania has heavily invested in network infrastructure providing the fastest download speeds in the country,” he said. He added, “We want everyone to be able to experience Vodacom supa network and enjoy the benefits that come with the internet,” With smart kitochi, an individual will be connected during festive season and enjoy 24GB data, free minutes and sms for six months from Vodacom with every smart kitochi purchased and a 10 per cent cash back with every purchase using M-Pesa. Vodacom’s supa network covers 92 per cent of Tanzania’s population with 3G, 4G and 4G+ sites across the country yet all this remains underutilized due to low smart phone penetrations in the country. “Our customers can get the smart kitochi from our Vodashops across the country and from the Smart Kitochi festive caravans which will take place in five regions of Mwanza, Arusha, Dodoma, Mbeya and Dar es Salaam. The caravans will feature exciting activities such as dance competitions, live shows and entertainment throughout the five regions,” he added.
