THE Weights and Measurement Agency (WMA) Standards Manager, Mr Jared Mushi, has called on traders to work with WMA to protect their products in the market, as one of the strategies for enhancing their business prospects. He made the call while speaking to traders at the Trade fair (Sabasaba) grounds in Dar es Salaam. "I am calling on manufacturers across the country to contact the WMA before and after production starts because measurements are accurate and will advertise their business," he said, adding: “The main function of the WMA is to manage the packaging, give professional advice for those involved in the manufacture, importation of various tests in the business, health, safety and environment sectors and to be a link between our nation and regional, as well as international institutions in the field of measurements." The manager said it would enable producers and the general public get more education as well as the work done by the WMA to avoid damages and loss. Mr Mushi said the WMA was in the process of testing electricity meters, which had previously not been done due to lack of equipment. The WMA Communications Manager, Irene John has thanked the government for providing electricity access to more people. She said the amendment to Act No 340 had imposed severe penalties to dishonest businessmen who tamper with processes. "The government capacity for the WMA is high; Now we have been able to reach all regions; Precise education has reached farmers and low-level producers,” Ms John said.
