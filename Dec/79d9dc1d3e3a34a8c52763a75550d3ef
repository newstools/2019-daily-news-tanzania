INVESTORS and business people should give generously money and other help so that consultative meetings between the government and the private sector can be held as per calendar in districts and regions. Speaking to members of the business community during a consultative meeting here recently, the Acting Executive Secretary of the Tanzania National Business Council (TNBC), Ms Oliva Vegulla, said TNBC regional and district meetings were irregularly held for lack of facilitation. “Meetings at regional and district levels are not held regularly for lack of money. We ask you to be part of the group of benefactors so that meetings can be held regularly; At least once a year,” she appealed, reminding her audience that ultimately it were the investors and traders who are cardinal beneficiaries of decisions made by such meeting. She reminded that improvement of investment and business climate in the country depended on ideas and suggestions given by members of the private sector in such meetings that are chaired by district and regional commissioners. TNBC has task forces on business climate, tourism, agriculture, industries and forestry that monitors and unearth problems, challenges and successes in the five strategic sectors. In a soul-searching intervention, Ms Vegulla said TNBC has to ensure the national industrialisation agenda succeeds and the business climate improves regularly. However, she said, that would depend on thoughts, dreams and suggestions given by investors and business people in district and regional meetings. The Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office (Investments), Ms Angela Kairuki, underscored the importance of those meetings, saying they give the private sector appropriate avenues for voicing its concerns and recommendations the government must act on. “The TNBC must ensure the meetings are held regularly so that the private sector can enumerate challenges that need to be solved by the government,” she said.
