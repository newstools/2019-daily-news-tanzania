TABORA Regional Commissioner (RC), Aggrey Mwanri has lauded JTI Leaf Services for initiating a project to plant over five million trees by December 16 and 17 in Tabora and Shinyanga regions respectively. Speaking during a press conference to unveil the initiative, Mr Mwanri said the project was professionally thought not only to beautify the region, but also help in environmental conservation. “I am told that this is a sustainable project that will continue every year on the stipulated dates,” he said adding, that it would also help sensitise members of the public on the importance of tree planting in areas the majority of people cut trees without replanting them. However, the RC called upon the residents, especially farmers, to embrace the project and ensure they planted enough trees and took care of them. “In the past we used to just plant trees and leave them to grow on their own and some ended up wilting, but the new JTI Leaf initiative emphasises that they are to be watered and well taken care of as they grow,” added Mr Mwanri. He called on local leaders to ensure the project was well-implemented and proper records were kept. For his part, JTI Leaf Agroforestry Manager, Alfadhil Makengo, who was also accompanied by the company’s Communications and Corporate Affairs Manager Bright Kiwia said they were implementing the project in 43 primary societies in Tabora and Ushetu districts in Shinyanga Region, where they were based. He said already all relevant parties had been consulted and briefed on the process since last month. Mr Makengo noted that December 16 and 17 would be the climax of tree planting sessions and would be marked every year, traced to the 2017/18 season when over 7 million trees were planted. Commenting, Kaliua District Commissioner (DC), Abel Busalama said his office would ensure the campaign succeeded, while applauding the company for complementing government efforts in tree planting as part of environmental conservation.
