MORE than 500 sports men and women joined for special Christmas bash at the Mirerani Township of Simanjiro, where veteran footballers as well as aged Yanga and Simba fans, treated the audience to friendly football match. Held at CCM grounds of Mirerani, the event was organised by the Tanzanite Community Empowerment Organization (TACEO), with an aim of bringing together, orphaned children, physically disabled persons and elder people to celebrate festive seasons. The full day bonanza started with variety of entertainment events before closing the day with veteran match in which Yanga Veterans beat Simba counterparts 1-0. Coincidentally, the goal was scored by Charles Mnyalu who also happened to be the event organiser. Children were given special prizes after the match. It is being anticipated that, the event will be repeated during the next Christmas 2020 season, but this time at another modern venue. The Simanjiro District Commissioner (DC), Zephania Chaula was the guest of honour during the event, which also involved luncheon for the participants. The DC lauded the organisers for their philanthropic efforts to unite the community. The Director of TACEO, Charles Mnyalu said they decided to organise the bonanza in order give back to the community what they have gained throughout the year. He said the organisation intends to start a special sporting academy that will recruit young talents. Charles also intends to invest and erect a large stadium, to be known as ‘Tanzanite Complex,’ at Mirerani Hills to help boost sporting activities in the area. The arena is going to sit 22,000 people, becoming the biggest playgrounds in the Northern Zone, if his words are anything to go by.
