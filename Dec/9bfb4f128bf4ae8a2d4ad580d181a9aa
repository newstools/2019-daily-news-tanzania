DAR ES SALAAM Stock Exchange (DSE) closed on the green last week and some analysts forecasting for a Santa Claus rally. The stock analysts prediction based on last week market capitalization surging by 0.72 per cent to 17.029tri/- pushed by cross listed firms. However, domestic market capitalization remained unchanged at 9.01tri/-. Zan Securities Chief Executive Officer Raphael Masumbuko said the bourse closed in green thanks to a positive performance from cross – listed counters. “We remain upbeat in our expectation of positive performance in the weeks ahead,” Mr Masumbuko said in a Weekly Market Wrap-Ups. The All Share Index (DSEI) gained 14.61 points to close the week at 2,051.20 points following a rally on KCB Bank and grew by 3.45 per cent and 1.15 per cent respectively. A Santa Claus rally is a calendar effect that involves a rise in stock prices during the last five trading days in December and the first two trading days in the following month. Orbit Securities said, however, the rally on the two counters was partially off-set by a decline on Kenya Airways (KQ) and JHL by 10 per cent and 1.52 per cent respectively, while NMG and USL remained constant. On other hand, Orbit said, domestic prices “have been rigid throughout December”, leaving the Tanzania Share Index (TSI) and the domestic market capitalisation similar to their positions since the end of November. “Price rigidity intensified after the introduction of the new trading rules sometime during August 2019,” Orbit said. The TSI has been on 3,431.10 points since the beginning of December, similar to the domestic market capitalisation which stands at 9.01tri/-. However, Zan Securities said the equity market turnover declined, indicating a change in last weeks’ momentum. The equities market turnover declined by 20 per cent to 3.23bn/- against last week’s 4.03bn/-. TBL reclaimed its position as at the top with 87.87 per cent of the total market turnover followed by CRDB with 11.46 per cent.
