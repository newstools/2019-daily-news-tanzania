IT was all smiles for orphans and vulnerable children after they were given free health insurance cards that will enable them to access medical treatment at any hospital in the country. At least 625 health insurance cards were provided to children from five districts in Dar es Salaam Region under the Community Health Fund (CHF). Speaking during the handover ceremony, Dar es Salaam Regional Commissioner Paul Makonda said the initiative was sponsored by the Embassy of Saudi Arabia for one year. Mr Makonda said the support aimed at simplifying health services to orphans and venerable children in the country. “When you meet an orphan, just think what if it happens to your son or daughter,” he said. He expressed his gratitude to the ambassador of Saudi Arabia, adding that they wanted to empower them today to live longer, healthier, happier lives – so that they could fulfill their potential and create for their tomorrow. In May 2019, Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa said Tanzania had at least 24,067 children cared for at 140 registered centres across the country where 11,925 males and 12,142 females were taken care of by individuals and private institutions. He further said the government had provided health insurance cards to 900 children from Dar es Salaam, Mbeya, Kilimanjaro and Arusha. Saudi Arabia Ambassador to Tanzania Mohamed bin Mansour said bilateral relations between the two countries had a long history because of shared values, including respect for humanity, non-interference in other countries’ affairs and support for global equality.
