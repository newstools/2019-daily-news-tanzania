AFTER registering a comfortable 5-0 victory over Eritrea in their opening match of the 2019 CECAFA Under- 17 Women Challenge Cup, Tanzania will today face Burundi hurdle in Jinja, Uganda. It is expected to be a gruelling but thrilling encounter at the FUFA Technical Centre, Njeru. Basing on Tanzania’s performance in the first game, it will definitely be a mountainous task for Burundi, who lost 4-0 in their opening game against hosts Uganda’s Crested Cranes on Monday. Burundi will be all out to recover and get back on track, while Tanzania will be seeking to maintain their perfect start to the campaign. Tanzania coach Bakari Shime said the match will be tough because Burundi will be looking to bounce back. “I believe the match against Burundi will be good for us, and we are determined to get good results and progress to the next stage,” “This tournament provides an opportunity for our teenagers to develop their skills …they are young and this will build their experience,” he said. Shime believes that the failure in the CECAFA Senior Women Challenge Cup presented a lesson to improve the performance of the U-17 squad in this other tournament. Meanwhile, striker Juliet Nalukenge continued with her scoring spree as hosts Uganda made a perfect start to the 2019 CECAFA U-17 Girls’ Championship on Monday. The lethal striker who has had a scintillating run this year proved too hard for Burundi to handle when she bagged a first half hat trick in the 4-0 win for Uganda at the FUFA Technical Centre, Njeru. The other goal was scored by Samalie Nakachwa in the second half to put the icing on the cake. Nalukenge who scored 18 goals as Uganda won the COSAFA U-17 Championship in September did not take too long to announce her presence breaking the deadlock as early as the 14th minute. She added the second in the 28th minute before completing her hat trick on the day eleven minutes later when Shakira Nyinagahirwa’s pass found her inside the area.
