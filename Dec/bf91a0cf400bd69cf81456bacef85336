OVER 950 patients from Mbande and Mbagala areas in Temeke Municipality have been offered a free medical checkup, treatment and medicine. The variety of medical services which were provided include general check-up, diabetes, eyesight test, high blood pressure, as well as counseling. Medical camps were under the sponsorship of the Lions Club of Dar es Salaam and New Century, which is a part of the club’s ongoing community health Initiative. Temeke Municipality Mayor, Mr Abdallah Chaurembo who visited the camp at Mbande Primary School, said the club has played an important role that ensures good health of Tanzanians. Mr Chaurembo said despite the government's efforts to provide health care, stakeholders are still needed to help communities cope with health challenges and that in doing so the public will be able to get quality health services. He also appreciated the support given by the main sponsors from Diamond Trust Bank in cooperation with Alliance Insurance, Tata Motors, Pee Tanzania Ltd, for supplying free medicines and accessories at the camp. On his part, Temeke District Medical Officer Dr Gwamaka Mwabulambo who visited the camp, said the district was looking forward to continuing to work with the club to ensure the public accesses quality health services. He said some people faced challenges related to cost of visiting doctors for consultations, checking and medicines. He said under the club’s initiatives, it was obvious majority Tanzanians would access good health services. Lions club meets the needs of local communities because they share a core belief to serve their community by conducting screenings, equipping hospitals and clinics, distributing medicine and raising awareness on eye diseases.
