THE management of KMC has announced that it will continue assessing the team, to eliminate all the shortfalls, which are contributing to its dismal performance this season. KMC, which finished on top four last season to earn a ticket of representing the country in CAF Confederation Cup, has had a bumpy ride so far in the Mainland Premier League. They occupy 17th slot on the table with nine points from 11 games with their latest clash ending 1-1 against Young Africans at the National Stadium last Monday. From 11 matches, the Kinondoni based side just won two games, drawing three and losing six encounters in that order no wonder, they are caught up in relegation zone. Speaking on the development, the club’s Chairman, Benjamin Sitta disclosed that KMC is a big brand, which deserves to be among the top five teams at the summit of the table. “Currently, we are scrutinizing every match seriously as one way to ensure that the team heads towards the right direction. We do not want to go back to the First Division League (FDL),” Sitta said. He continued that the process to identity and eliminate hindrances in the team will not stop until they get back on track and start winning matches. “We started the campaign by taking action against our former coach (Jackson Mayanja) and it is an ongoing mission. Our hope is that we will make a turnaround because last season, we began the league in the similar fashion but later managed to make things right,” he insisted. He also remarked that basing on the squad they have, finishing into the top four positions at the end of the season is very possible. Elaborating on when the new coach will be paraded at the club, Sitta said they plan to finish that process during the upcoming mini transfer window.
