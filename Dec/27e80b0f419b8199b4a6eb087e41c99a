DEPUTY Permanent Secretary (PS) in the Ministry of Finance and Planning Amina Khamis Shaaban has asked the Procurement and Supplies Professionals and Technicians Board (PSPTB) to apply the law in punishing employers in the public service who offer jobs to unqualified professionals. The deputy PS equally directed the board to institute legal action against officials who disregarded for the procurement law and ended up occasioning losses to the government. Ms Shaaban was speaking when closing the 10th professionals annual conference with the theme: ”Sustainable Procurement and Supply Chain Practices for Modern Economy.” The three-day conference, which kicked off on Tuesday, ended on Thursday. Various audit reports from the office of the Controller and Auditor General (CAG) in different fiscal years uncovered dubious procurement processes, which attracted professionals at the conference to suggest how best PSPTB could address the challenge. Even a recent CAG report has found out that there was laxity within procurement entities (PEs) in ministries and public institutions. Therefore, when closing the annual conference, the deputy PS insisted in her concluding remarks that it was important to observe honesty, professionalism and accountability. Earlier, Commissioner for Policy and Procurement, Dr Fredrick Mwakibinga, said the government was serious with procurement legislation that was why it was holding yearly professional conferences to remind experts in the procurement and supply chain of their obligations. During a three-day conference, Dr Mwakibinga said, about 10 topics were discussed by professionals and 602 participants had ample time to share experience and knowledge which would help compliment the fifth phase government the ambitious drive of transforming the country into a middleincome economy.
