NATIONAL Investment Company Limited (NICOL) is expected to suffer minimal share price shock after the government nullified Dodoma’s abattoir contract. The contract, between NICOL, listed on Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange and Tanzania Meat Company (TMCL), was revoked two days ago for mismanagement. But, stock market analysts said they see little impact on the NICOL share price at the bourse since TMCL was a loss marking entity and had minor revenue contribution to the former. Zan Securities, Advisory and Capital Markets Manager, Ahmed Nganya said the impact are foreseen on fine and liabilities than on the share prices. “The impact on NICOL will only come from the fines and liabilities of TMCL that they have to cover.” “The abattoir was a burden on NICOL finances since the company needs several equities funding to remain afloat,” Nganya told the ‘Daily News’ on Tuesday. The government ordered NICOL, a mutual fund, to pay 9.7bn/- to treasury and refund 5.2bn/- it owed the TMCL partnership. The government said the abattoir since privatized was loss-making entity for the last 11 years while some assets disappeared and became obsolete. The government also directed National Ranch Company (NARCO) to withdraw from being shareholders of TMCL in 60 days. Orbit Securities Market Analyst Mr Imani Muhingo seconded Mr Nganya saying the fine are a lot and are equivalent of NICOL’s three years revenues. “The intense issue is the penalty (NICOL) ordered to pay. More than 14bn/- that are a lot, about three years revenue, but for now I don’t think the shares will drop,” Mr Muhingo told the ‘Daily News’. NICOL, by last month, had more than 30,000 shareholders and its share was trading at 175/- which was a drop of over 50 per cent since the beginning of the year when trade at 250/-.
