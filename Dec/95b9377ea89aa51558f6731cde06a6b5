BARCLAYS Tanzania on Wednesday revealed its second rebranded branch in Arusha Region as it gets ready to change its name to Absa in the near future. The Bank’s Managing Director Mr Abdi Mohamed said the bank is preparing to change its name in line with its parent company’s decision to rebrand all its operations and will change from Barclays Bank Tanzania to Absa Bank Tanzania. “From our new branches, we will embrace our ambition of becoming an independent African bank, under a new brand, Absa,” he said. The Arusha rebranded branch is completely new located within the newly built Ngorongoro Tourism Center having vibrant red color palette of the Absa brand. Mr Mohamed said the state of the art, paperless branch is equipped with internet banking facilities and newly branded ATMs, all carrying the Absa logo. Last week the bank launched its first Absa-branded branch in Tanzania at Mikocheni area. “We are here to fulfill the ambitions of our customers and communities and we look forward to continue building strong partnerships to make this a reality,” he said. Even though some branches will start to look like Absa, it will continue to operate and trade as Barclays Bank Tanzania until its name officially changes. The bank has several legal and regulatory milestones to achieve before the official name change date can be announced. Barclays Chairman, Simon Mponji, said, “Recognising the significant size of the task ahead and in preparation to name change we started introducing Absa’s warm, vibrant red colour palette on some of our assets, including bank branches and ATMs, to ensure we are fully ready by the time our legal name changes. The name change in Tanzania is part of one of the largest rebranding projects in Africa and part of a broader, multi-country rebrand programme happening at Absa Group Limited- level, scheduled to be completed by mid-next year.
