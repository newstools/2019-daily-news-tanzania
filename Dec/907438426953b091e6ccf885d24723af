THE Archbishop of Dodoma Archdiocese, Beatus Kinyaiya has asked married men to refrain from torturing their wives, whenever they have disagreements as it awash in the press. He also asked other citizens to ensure that they maintain peace so that the country remains stable for other developments to spring from. Archbishop Kinyaiya speaking during the Christmas Eve sermon at St Paul of the Cross Roman Catholic Church in Dodoma, further noted that there were several complaints from a section of people on Gender Based Violence (GBV), in marriages, which can be addressed. “For a Christian who is God fearing it is not proper to do that, so I urge you to refrain from such acts and maintain respect in the community. Why must you to that extent, while you pledged to live with your wife in all circumstances, however, I ask you to use this Christmas Day to make possible changes in your hearts and minds,” he told the congregation. The cleric further said that in the Christian faith, to humiliate a woman is improper, adding that the most important thing is to educate her or seek for dia logue to address differences. In a related development, the prelate asked also religious leaders to continue preaching peace and the word of God, which would ensure that the country remains peaceful as it has been since independence.
