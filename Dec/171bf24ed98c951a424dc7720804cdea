GEOLOGICAL Survey of Tanzania (GST), a public geoscientific organisation, is urging minerals stakeholders to make use of its laboratory for ideal results in the development of mineral sector in the country. The call was made here recently in a symposium on sustainable management of environment in mineral sector by GST Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Dr Mussa Budeba, adding that GST laboratory is ready to receive various samples for experiment. GST focuses on Precambrian geology, Proterozoic geology, Paleozoic geology, quaternary geology and natural earth resources. It has experienced scientists specialised in various aspects of geology, environmental research, geophysics, geochemistry and information technology. “Make use of GST laboratory, which is now worldwide and recognized after receiving accreditation, for ideal results,” the GST added, while addressing a number of stakeholders from mining companies and private institutions, who were attending the symposium. GST is also taking part in the exhibition which is part of the symposium and organised by the Minerals Ministry. On his part, GST acting Geological Service Director, Mr Maruko Msechu, said that they have been conducting research on minerals, and urged mining companies to bank on their laboratory to establish magnitude of minerals in their mines. Expounding, he urged the mining companies to set aside some of their budgets for research which will establish quantity and quality of minerals in their mines, and statistics to be used in their other projects. The occasion was graced by Minerals Minister, Mr Dotto Biteko, and also attended by Permanent Secretary in the Minerals Ministry, Prof Simon Msanjila and Chairman for Minerals Commission, Prof Idris Kikula.
