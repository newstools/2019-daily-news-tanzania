ALGHOUGH tens of thousands of children have missed out on their first choice of secondary school for the 2020/21 academic year, 701,038 candidates (92.27 per cent) candidates have been selected to join secondary education. Early figures released by Minister of State in the President’s Office (Regional Administration and Local Government) Sulemani Jafo show that 58,699 children from Dar es Salaam, Mara, Arusha, Iringa, Lindi, Manyara, Mbeya, Coast, Rukwa, Simiyu, Songwe, Tanga and Kigoma regions will have to wait for second selection. The following are regions and the number of children in brackets, Arusha (4,739), Dar es Salaam (5,808), Iringa (3,480), Kigoma (12,092), Lindi (1,695), Manyara (728), Mara (9,493), Mbeya (2,716), Coast (2,918), Rukwa (686), Simiyu (6,616), Songwe (4,684) and Tanga (3,044) – these couldn’t be selected due to limited space. The minister said over 700,000 candidates of those, who successfully completed primary education and qualified to join Form One, had been selected to join various daily, boarding and special schools in the 2020/21 academic year. But the minister was quick to warn that all those who had not been selected should not be discouraged in anyway. “This is a directive especially to school boards to ensure every selected candidate joins Form One when the school academic programme starts,” he added. The minister went on to note that, some schools have been blaming school boards for having approved certain contributions. This should not be a principal requirement for a child to join school. As the government embarked on free education for primary and secondary education, it wants parents and guardians to ensure children have uniforms, exercise books and other study materials. The figures released by the minister show candidates from almost half the number of the regions (13 regions) that passed their primary school education final exams will join Form One. Over 5,000 candidates from Dar es Salaam, 9,000 candidates from Mara and 12,000 other candidates from Kigoma were announced to have missed out on first selection. Mr Jafo emphasised that none of the parents would be demanded to pay for a school desk, school construction or security contributions, as all such costs had been paid by the government. If anything, any need of contribution it must be proposed to and approved by the district commissioner who will have to confirm with the permanent secretary in the Ministry of Regional Administration and Local Government. Out of the selected candidates, boys are 335,513 (47.86 per cent), slightly lower than 52.14 per cent of girls or 365,525 selected to report to their respective public secondary schools. Only 0.14 per cent, however, of the selected candidates (3,145 candidates) will be admitted to boarding schools. This means, 970 candidates will join high performing (special) schools, 1,095 will be enrolled in technical schools and 1,080 candidates will complete their secondary school in ordinary boarding schools. A big number of candidates 697,893 (99.59 per cent) will join ward secondary schools. Even though, the minister directed regional and district commissioners and council directors to ensure they completed the construction and renovation of classrooms by February next year.
