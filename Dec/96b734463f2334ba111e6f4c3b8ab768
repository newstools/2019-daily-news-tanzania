THE Basic Para-Swimming coaching course, which is expected to begin on Monday to Friday at Nordic School in Masaki, Dar es Salaam has received timely support from Desmi Africa Limited. About 30 coaches from Tanzania Mainland and Zanzibar are lined up to attend the training, which aims at increasing the number of Para-Swimming coaches in the country. Breaking the good news yesterday here was the course Coordinator, Ramadhan Namkoveka, who commended the firm for agreeing to sponsor the four-day training. “On behalf of the Tanzania Paralympics Committee (TPC), let me thank Desmi Africa Limited for this positive gesture, which will help a lot to achieve the objectives of the course. I hope they will continue to come to our rescue in other training programmes and competitions coming ahead,” he said. He added that one of the main reasons for the training is to develop coaches working with para-athletes at club level in various parts of the country. Namkoveka then requested for more support from companies, stakeholders and individuals to come forward and help them just like what Desmi Africa Limited have done. According to him, 15 paraswimmers will be further drilled with necessary skills they need to know throughout the course. “We want to increase the number of Para-Swimming coaches, who will again be responsible to teach others about the sport in various areas they reside,” he said. On his part, Desmi Africa Limited Managing Director Leslie Andrews confirmed that they have pumped in a certain amount to help run the course smoothly. “When we heard that TPC is looking for sponsors of the training, we never had to think twice but rather made the decision to help them,” Andrews said.
