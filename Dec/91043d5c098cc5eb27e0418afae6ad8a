SIMBA SC defender Gerson Fraga Vieira said the understanding of Kiswahili language has made him to cooperate well with his teammates on the battlefield. The Brazilian player joined the defending champions this season and has been one of the regular players for the Msimbazi Street based side under the tutelage of the departed Head Coach Patrick Aussems. He was reportedly brought as a replacement of Ugandan defender Jjuuko Murshid, who could not continue trading with the reigning champions this season. Speaking in Dar es Salaam recently, Vieira revealed that he has so far managed to learn key Kiswahili words, which make communication with fellow players on the pitch easy. “Previously, I had difficult time to understand what my teammates were trying to say during matches but now, I can understand what they say and I can speak some Kiswahili words with them like Mbele, Kushoto and Kulia. I am glad now that we understand each other,” he said. He added that he feels happy whenever he is included in the first eleven of the team, saying that it is the dream of any player as nobody wants to be benched. “The competition within the squad is always stiff but that is good for the club because it makes us to work hard,” he said. Moreover, the 27 year old centre back said he is now feeling comfortable with the weather despite yet to score a league goal for his side. “Always, I try to put myself in a match and work hard to the best of my ability. Slowly, I am getting close to score my first goal here at Simba,” he said. On a laughing note, the defender disclosed that he is now getting used to Tanzania foods and that he likes Pilau, Samaki and Wali Maharage. Simba still tops the 20-team league pile with 25 points from ten games after winning eight clashes and losing one match. They have scored 19 goals similar to 7th placed Lipuli FC but the Reds are currently the only team to concede few goals (3).
