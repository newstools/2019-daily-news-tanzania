THE Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries Permanent Secretary, Professor Elisante Ole Gabriel has asked investors in the National Ranching Company Limited (NARCO), to ensure that they clear their outstanding debts, lest they be dismissed. Prof Ole Gabriel issued the directives, recently while visiting the Kongwa Ranch to inspect how they run their operations and businesses. The PS equally issued Kongwa Ranch with 38 days to have a slaughterhouse near the Dodoma to Dar es Salaam road to increase their business premises. He said the decision by investors not to pay government dues in the plots, was derailing the authority’s efforts to collect enough revenue. “Hence, I would ask all investors to pay all their outstanding debts immediately, otherwise immediate legal actions would follow. Every investment you are making in these plots should be paid for…the government will not hesitate to take appropriate measures against all defaulters,” pointed out the PS. In a related development, Prof Ole Gabriel asked NARCO to run its business professionally and digitally, adding that: “By January 31 in 2020, I expect to see Kongwa Ranch having built abattoirs along the main road, where citizens and commuters would have access to their services, and the Minister, Luhaga Mpina would come to launch.”
