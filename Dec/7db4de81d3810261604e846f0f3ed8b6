TANGA Regional Administrative Secretary (RAS), Zena Said has appealed to Tanzanians to assess themselves how much they have contributed in cash or in kind towards the improvement of health services. She was speaking at the handover of modern medical equipment worth 135m/- for the newly constructed Kwediboma Health Centre in Kilindi District. The medical equipment was donated by a Japanese nongovernmental organisation, Azora, in response to a request made by the World Vision Tanzania (WVT) which has contributed to the construction of the new health facility. Ms Said pointed out that Tanzanians were living in a century where everybody needed to get better health services. “That is why the government has constructed 20 new health centres in Tanga Region,” she said. The RAS thanked Azora Director, Dr Kito Hada, the World Vision and Kwediboma Community for the construction of the health centre. Ms Said asked the World Vision Tanzania and Japan and Azora to boost the construction of a health centre near the centre for emergency services. “I know the Japanese are generous people and would surely agree to this request,” she said. Speaking at the event, Dr Hada said the support was “a dream comes true” for him because improving people’s health had always been a passion for him. “I took this profession to save lives in Africa,” he said
