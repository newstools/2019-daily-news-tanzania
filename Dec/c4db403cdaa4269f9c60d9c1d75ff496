CBA bank in cooperation with Vodacom Tanzania have set aside more than 10m/- worthy awards for customers who uses an online banking dubbed as M-Pawa during festive seasons. The awards include motorcycles, receiving 100 percent of their savings and the climax will be the top draw where the winner will walk away with 10m/-cash in the final prize. “The final draw will be in the first week of January 2020 where the lucky winner will be given 10m/-. This is part of giving back to the society to customers who uses M-Pawa mobile banking to do their saving, withdraw and repay loans,” said Ms Gloria Njiu, the CBA bank’s Mpawa Manager this past weekend. She was speaking shortly after handing a new motorbike to Ms Leticis Yohana (26) a Dar es Salaam based food vender who was last week M-pawa winner this past weekend. Ms Gloria said that for Tanzanians to win the awards, all the needed to do was use the simple banking service which uses a mobile phone to Vodacom subscribers who uses the mobile money service. She said it was a right time for Tanzanians to join their peers to access simplified bank services through M-Pawa to do their savings and access simple loans. “Less than 20 percent of Tanzanians have bank accounts, since the introduction of M-Pawa, customers have hiked to eight millions who do transactions including the access short time loans. As we give back to the society in the season, we also call for others to take part and access flexible formal banking system,” she persuaded. She insisted that the winners of the prizes in the draw slight to run for six weeks are expected to be the regular users of M-Pawa who do save, take loans and repay back on time. M-Pawa is a mobile telephone based banking system joint operated by CBA bank and vodacom Tanzania.
