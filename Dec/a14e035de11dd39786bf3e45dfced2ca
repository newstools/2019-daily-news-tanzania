DEPUTY Permanent Secretary (PS) in President's Office [Regional Administration and Local Government (Education)] Gerald Mweli has urged education officers (academic) to insist on data management to avoid challenges caused by poor data management. Speaking during the closing of phase II of leadership and education supervision training to regional and council education officers from Mainland Tanzanian at the weekend he said there had been many challenges in data collection that needed to be addressed. â€œWrong data has caused difficulty in budget preparations, poor planning for our resources and even failure to make right decisions in many aspects in our sector. It is your responsibility to ensure all data and other information collected in your areas is reliable to avoid these problems," he noted. For his part, Agency for the Development of Educational Management (ADEM) officer-in-charge Sixton Masanja said training had covered all important topics that would help participants to improve performance in their daily activities. " You have stayed here for all these four days, we expect you to use the knowledge you have acquired to bring about change in the education sector and in your workplace," he added. One of the participants, Mr Mtobi Edward, Education Academic Officer (Simiyu) thanked the government for such rare opportunity, saying it would help them and new teachers cope with a teaching environment. For her part, the chairperson of Dar es Salaam Teachers Union Amina Kasenge pointed out that they would continue supporting such training since it was one of their responsibilities to ensure education professionals were well educated. The training was attended by 422 participants from across the country.
