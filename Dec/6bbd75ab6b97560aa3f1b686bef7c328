YOUTHS, particularly the jobless here should expect a better future as far as employment is concerned once a new plan to support them is successfully implemented. This follows the signing of an agreement between Zanzibar’s ‘Small and Medium Industries Development Agency (SMIDA) and the Private Agricultural Sector Support (PASS) to help the youths move forward economically. According to available data, the rate of unemployment in Zanzibar has remained above 17 per cent, with government authorities in collaboration with private sector struggling to overcome the burden by supporting entrepreneurship. During the signing ceremony held at the Ministry of Trade and Industries, the Ministry’s Deputy Principal Secretary, Ms Khadija Khamis Rajab said the main objective in the agreement is to support development ideas that will result in establishing light industries for the idle youths to get employed. She appealed to the youths to utilise this opportunity, telling them to be innovative and come forward with better idea/plans to become entrepreneurs. The agreement was signed by Ms Rajab and the PASS Executive Director, Mr Nicomed Bohay, who said that the target is to support establishment of at least 25 entrepreneur projects that will result in creating more jobs for the youths. “We encourage youths with some experience in entrepreneurship to apply for the opportunity,” Bohay said as he thanked the Zanzibar government for strengthening collaboration in promoting youths. The Minister for Trade and Industries, Ambassador Amina Salim Ali said the SMIDA and PASS agreement is a milestone in solving the unemployment burden in the country. She reiterated the government’s commitment in ensuring the jobless youths are employed.
