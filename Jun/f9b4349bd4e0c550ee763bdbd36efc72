THE General Election for Arusha District Football Association (ADFA), has been suspended, pending further notice; it has just been announced here. The Arusha (Urban) District Football Association (ADFA), had initially planned to conduct its election this June, but as it happens, the polls have been forced into cancellation because the association’s newly updated constitution remains invalid. The Arusha Urban District Sports Officer and Deputy Registrar of Sports Associations, Benson Maneno pointed out here that the ADFA election breached sports club regulations as per the office of sports clubs registration requirements. “The ARDFA revised constitution was supposed to be approved by the Association’s extra ordinary General Elections, but apparently this has not happened and therefore the registrar will not endorse the document as valid guidance towards the elections,” said Maneno. Omar Walii, who is the chairperson of the Arusha District Football Association, has admitted that they have been compelled to suspend the June 2019 elections because the revised constitution must first be approved by the soon to be convened extra general meeting of ADFA.
