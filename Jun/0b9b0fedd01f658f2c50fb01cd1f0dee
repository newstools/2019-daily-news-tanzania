SIMBA Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Crecentious Magori has clarified his future at the club after days of rumours suggesting that he has parted ways with the team. Magori confirmed that his six months’ probation period at the club had elapsed but the club’s Board requested him to extend his stay for at least two months of which he agreed. He said the club’s board will then initiate a process to get a new CEO and hire several other directors, who will be assigned different duties at the club. He said the club will soon announce the vacancies via media. Magori said during a press conference in Dar es Salaam yesterday that the board of the club which met on Wednesday resolved on several issues, including the stalled project to construct team’s training base at Bunju, saying artificial turf will soon be laid at the ground. He said a Chinese company has been contracted to finalise laying of artificial turf and construct another natural grass pitch adjacent to the artificial one. He said the company will also be tasked to construct dressing room at the site. Magori further said that former team Manager, Richard Robert has been tasked to be in charge of the Bunju project. Magori also said the club has signed deal with Dubai based company Uhlsport to supply new kit effective from the coming season. He said as usual, the kit will bear red colours for home matches, while white will be for away matches and grey as stand by colour as recommended in CAF regulations that a club must have at least three different coloured kits per season. The CEO said three foreign based companies submitted their bids to supply the kits, which included Novum from Singapore, Umbro from South Africa branch and Uhlsport Dubai branch.
