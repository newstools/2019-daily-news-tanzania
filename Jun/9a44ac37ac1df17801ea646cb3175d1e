TANZANIA Insurance Regulatory Authority (TIRA) has embarked on a crackdown on fake vehicle insurance in Dodoma Municipal Council to solve the problem of forged vehicle insurance in the capital city. Central Zone TIRA Manager Stella Rutaguza told the ‘Daily News’ yesterday that the insurance watchdog, which has teamed up with the Police Force in the crackdown, had so far impounded 14 vehicles, five rickshaw motorcycles and two motorcycles with forged insurance. “Some 500 vehicles were inspected in the crackdown in different areas of Dodoma municipality last week,” the Central Zone TIRA boss said when briefing this newspaper on the ongoing exercise. Ms Rutaguza said the exercise would be sustainable and aimed at solving the problem in Dodoma Municipal Council and urged owners of vehicles to stop purchasing vehicle insurance from unauthorised offices. She said vehicle owners could verify if a vehicle insurance cover was genuine through TIRA MIS App, pointing out the App, which could be downloaded from the Internet or smart phones. Ms Rutaguza said it was vital to get a genuine motor insurance cover because it provided financial protection against physical damage or bodily injury resulting from accidents and offered financial protection in case there was theft or damage to a vehicle involved in the accident. For his part, Dodoma Regional Police Commander (RPC) Gilles Muroto said a 32-year-old man was arrested in connection with fake vehicle insurance in Dodoma Municipal Council, saying the suspect, who was identified as Mr Y unus Ramadhani, was held at the Central Police Station pending investigation. He said Mr Ramadhani, who has no business licence, was found with forged motor insurance cover notes of different insurance firms, saying the suspect worked as a marketing officer at Boxer motorcycle brand dealers at its Dodoma branch. “The suspect has denied the government billions of shillings for selling forged vehicle insurance,” the RPC told a press conference at the weekend.
