President John Magufuli said he will be happy if he will leave more than 100 new billionaires at the end of his tenure. Dr Magufuli said this at a meeting with businesspeople held at the State House in Dar es Salaam early on Friday. The meeting is a platform for both the public and private sectors to address business environment challenges and find ways of addressing them. The President challenged Tanzania Private Sector Foundation that it had not been inclusive enough to accommodate small traders, saying,“ currently TPSF is being viewed as a special group for special people.” Some of the businesspeople told Dr Magufuli that some challenges facing them were dubious taxes and some public institutions were not purchasing locally-produced products.
