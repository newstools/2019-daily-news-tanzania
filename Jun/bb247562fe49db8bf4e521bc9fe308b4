KMC yesterday paraded Ugandan trainer, Jackson Mayanja as new Head Coach to take charge of the team for a renewable one year contract. Mayanja has since returned to work in the country after a successful stay at Simba SC where he traded as the Head Coach and Assistant Coach respectively. He has a big task ahead of steering KMC, which is going to compete in the four major competitions -- Kagame Cup, CAF Confederation Cup, Mainland Premier League and Azam Sports Federation Cup (ASFC). In his brief remarks, Kinondoni Municipal Council Mayor Benjamin Sitta said Mayanja is the right person to navigate the team since he has vast experience in international games. “As you are aware, it has taken us a long period before announcing the new coach because we were keenly scrutinizing many candidates who showed interest to coach KMC,” Sitta said. He added: “We have been thoroughly following him ever since he left the country and we are pleased that he was on the forefront coaching youth teams, an area we want to invest a lot at KMC hence I believe that he is going to do his roles well.” Moreover, Sitta labelled Mayanja as a disciplined person, the same qualities he said are good to be nurtured among KMC players as one way to propel the team further. He then congratulated KMC management for taking enough time to select the right person for the job insisting that it was not that easy. In his words, Mayanja said he is happy to return back to land back on Tanzania soil, saying he is going to bring a new philosophy at his new club. “I know them (KMC) well and they play good football but we need to double our efforts in order to achieve desired outcome for the health of the team,” he said. Mayanja continued: “Wherever I work, I do impart a new culture of football and I want to do the same with KMC so that the pride of the team should not be lost.”
