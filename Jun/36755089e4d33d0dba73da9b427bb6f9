MINISTER of State in the President’s Office (Regional Administration and Local Government) Selemani Jafo has been dissatisfied with slow progress of the construction projects of two secondary schools in Kongwa District. Accordingly, he directed the head of the Secondary Education Department in Kongwa District Council, Mr Nelson Milanzi, to make a written statement on the slow progress of the construction projects. “I am not satisfied with the progress of the construction projects. For six months now, the construction is still at primary elements,” said the minister yesterday after visiting construction project sites for Kongwa and Sejeli secondary schools. Mr Milanzi, who is presently at Union of Secondary School Games in Mtwara Region, was directed by the minister to return to his working station and return his per diem allowance. Mr Jafo said the government had disbursed funds for construction projects since January this year, saying other district councils were finalising their construction projects ready to receive Form Five students. “Make a call to him to immediately come back to his workplace and make a written statement on the slow progress of the construction projects,” stressed the minister. While briefing the minister, Kongwa District Executive Director, Dr Omary Nkulo, said delays in the implementation of two secondary school projects were a shortage of contractors and a technician was supervising both projects.
