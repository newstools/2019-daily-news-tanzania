GLORY of Christ Tanzania Church (GCTC) Archbishop Josephat Gwajima yesterday praised President John Magufuli for his sterling leadership particularly in execution of flagship projects. The spiritual leader cited implementation of Rufiji— Stiegler’s Gorge—hydropower project as one of the milestone achievements and landmark projects under Dr Magufuli’s tutelage. Bishop Gwajima expressed his appreciation and satisfaction soon after he met President Magufuli at the State House in Dar es Salaam. He said that despite the fact that his predecessors did a lot to produce enough electricity, yet power that will be produced from Rufiji project will surpass all production since the beginning of Tanzania. The Archbishop commended President Magufuli for engineering the implementation of the project amid environmental concerns orchestrated by western people. “As you know, most people from Western countries labeled the area for environment conservation, but the truth is that it is merely international politics. We are obliged to protect our national interests, nobody should tell us to do something in the interests of Western countries. In this case, eggs must be broken to get fried eggchips,” stressed Archbishop Gwajima. He reminded Tanzanians to consider some factors first if they have to move faster from the current situation to bright future, expressing hope that there is bright future in store for Tanzanians—they only have to work hard. “My message to Tanzanians is that this is a race and therefore is not for lazy people, people worldwide are running so we shouldn’t sleep. We must run like others in the world so that to keep pace with the globe. And, I’m sure we will arrive in our destination sooner and safely,” he stressed. Archbishop Gwajima added that work discipline and responsibility had recently increased and must be maintained to achieve the envisaged goals.
