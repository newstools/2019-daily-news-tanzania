AS Eid al Fitr celebrations come to an end, President Ali Mohamed Shein has reminded drivers in the country to obey traffic rules to avoid road accidents. In a meeting with children members of the press or Kid Reporters at the State House here, Dr Shein said children need protection and love from all, including drivers so that they can roam and enjoy the festival. It has been a tradition for the state owned Zanzibar Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) to organize for kid reporters to visit the State House and interview the president during Eid celebrations. “During celebrations like Eid, there are more people on the roads and streets, majority being children. Therefore drivers should take precaution by observing road safety measures or risk prosecution,” he said after the reporters asked him on any message he had for motorists. The meeting was also an opportunity for Dr Shein to remind and encourage children to work harder in schools so that they can perform well in examinations. “Avoid walking alone, wearing expensive things, and getting engaged in misbehavior to minimize abuse temptation,” Dr. Shein said. In Zanzibar, Eid celebrations normally last for four consecutive days.
