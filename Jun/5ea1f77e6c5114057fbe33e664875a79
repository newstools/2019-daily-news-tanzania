NATIONAL Bank of Commerce (NBC) has embarked on programme to offer practical knowledge to university students countrywide that will equip them with the banking operation skills. To start with, NBC over the weekend, lectured some undergraduate and post-graduate students of University of Dar es Salaam Business School before going to other universities. NBC’s Director for Treasury and Financial Market Mr Peter Nalitolela said the aim was to equip would-bebankers with banking sector know-how to become employable after graduating. “We want them to translate theory they got from their classes into practice and become competitive in the job market,” Mr Nalitolela said. The lender, one of top five in the country, would train UDBS students for the remaining part of the year by inviting various NBC staff for practical lecturing. The bank said the programme is part of the lender’s Cooperate Social Responsibility (CSR), helping the students acquire required banking knowledge. UDBS Assistant Lecturer Mr Ndasile Chamkunde said that getting visiting lecturer from banking industry to share knowledge was important aspect in preparing the students for labour market. “In the classes we normally teach them general knowledge, but the people who work in the industry would tell them specific skills needed,” Mr Chamkunde said. One of students attended the lecture, Jovitus Osward, said the training has enabled him to know better the way local banks operate thus cementing class lecture further
