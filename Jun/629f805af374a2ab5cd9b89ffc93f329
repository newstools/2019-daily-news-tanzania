FIVE villages of Serengeti District in Mara Region have shared a cake of over one billion shillings equally, which is 50 per cent of Ikona Wildlife Management Area (WMA)’s revenue in the 2018/2019 financial year. “The funds have been spent to finance development projects in the villages,” the WMA Secretary, Mr Yusufu Manyanda, told the ‘Daily News’ in Mugumu yesterday. Singita Grumeti Reserve is the largest source of income of the WMA, which forms integral part of the Serengeti ecosystem. Between 2014 and 2018 alone, WMA received 1,529, 289 US dollars (over 3.5 bnl-)from the investor, Singita Grumeti. One of the latest projects funded by the WMA’s revenue is construction of a new public secondary school at Makundusi village. It was launched by the 2019 National Uhuru Torch Race leader, Mzee Mkongea Ali recently, according to Serengeti District Commissioner (DC), Nurdin Babu. Besides Makundusi, other villages benefiting from WMA are Robanda, Park Nyigoti, Natta and Nyichoka. The villages established WMA in 2007. “Our target in the 2018/2019 financial year was to collect around 3 bnl-but we have collected a little over bnl-and we are still expecting more funds because the financial year has not ended,” the WMA secretary said. He hinted that WMA was expected to get 124 ml- more from Singita Grumeti soon, saying it had disbursed millions of shillings to finance various development projects in villages every year. “The money has been spent on construction projects that include teachers’ houses, a modern office at Park Nyogoti village and a police station in Robanda village,” he added. WMA spends 50 percent of its revenue on conservation activities, according to Mr Manyanda . “We always ensure that 50 per cent of the revenue goes to the villages to finance development projects and we spend the remaining 50 percent on conservation activities like buying patrol vehicles, paying salaries of Village Game Scouts(VGS), and protecting wildlife inside the WMA,” he explained.
