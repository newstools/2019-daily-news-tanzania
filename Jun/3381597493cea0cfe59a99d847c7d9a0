NORWAY Ambassador to Tanzania Elisabeth Jacobson has wished well Magnet Youth Academy Organisation (MYAO) team as they prepare to represent the country in 2019 Norway Cup early next month. She extended her blessings recently in Dar es Salaam after visiting the team’s training session prior to the commencement of the annual biggest and oldest youth football competition to be staged in Oslo, Norway next month. Addressing the players, Jacobson urged them to utilise well this opportunity and play good football to win so that they should bring home the trophy. “I know that this is the second time for you to compete in the competition. Make sure to use well this platform by playing fair-play matches without hurting each other and make new friends plus knowing other cultures from people you will meet there,” the ambassador said. She added: “Sports help a lot to stimulate people such that the more you keep playing, the better you will become reliable players for the national team.” She therefore awarded MYAO with a special ball which contains 17 developmental goals as agreed by countries all over the world. The ambassador then thanked Tanzania government for banning the use of plastic bags saying the move has made the country popular in Europe as far as protecting environment is concerned. In his words, MYAO Chairman Tuntufye Mwambusi hailed the ambassador for visiting them insisting that no amount of money can buy that good gesture. “We never invited her to come. She heard that a team from Tanzania is going to compete in the Norway Cup and decided to meet the players. It is very encouraging for us,” Mwambusi said. He further said they plan to send more teams next year to beat the current number of three teams which will make the trip so as to expose as many youths as possible.
