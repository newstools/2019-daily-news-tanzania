FINALLY victims of Gender Based Violence (GBV), in Tarime and Rorya districts have started reporting to the police gender and children desks, thanks to ongoing anti- GBV campaigns in Mara Region. “People have now understood the meaning and the effects of GBV. As a result, GBV cases which are being reported are increasing each day,” the Gender and Children Desk Coordinator in Tarime Rorya Special Police Zone, Mr Claude Mtweve, said here recently. That has made it possible for GBV perpetrators to be arrested and face legal actions in the districts where women and girls are the major victims of GBV acts. “It is now common for people to report even minor cases that were not reported in the past and we are taking timely legal actions, “ Mr Mtweve added. He was speaking during the latest anti-GBV campaigns held in Susuni Ward in Tarime District under a new initiative that involves groups composed of male adults to fight child marriage, teenage pregnancy and Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), in the area. The event was organized by Children’s Dignity Forum (CDF), a non-governmental organization that fights child marriage, teenage pregnancy and FGM in the area. “Besides helping to report GBV cases at police posts, the groups are now in the frontline of spreading anti-GBV education and we believe they will continue to facilitate victory in this battle, “ Mr Jovitus Alphonce, an official from CDF in the Tarime office said. Mr Alphonce said FGM, child marriage and teenage pregnancies were big challenges that had to be fought relentlessly as they curtailed the life goals of girls.
