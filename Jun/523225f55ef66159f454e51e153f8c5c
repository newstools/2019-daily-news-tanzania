MOTORISTS began to dig deeper into their pockets to refill their tanks from yesterday as fuel prices increased due to a rise in prices for petroleum products in the international market. The Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority (EWURA) announced yesterday that petrol and diesel prices imported in the country through Dar es Salaam, Tanga and Mtwara ports have increased as global oil market prices and bulk procurement system (BPS) premiums increased. Retail prices of Petrol, Diesel and Kerosene increased by 120/- per litre (equivalent to 5.35 per cent), 39/- per litre (equivalent to 1.81 per cent) and 70/- per litre (equivalent to 3.34 per cent) respectively. Cap prices for petrol in Dar es Salaam will be 2,353/- per litre up from 2,233/- in May, while diesel prices have gone up to 2,220/- per litre from 2,181/- in May and kerosene prices have shot to 2,180/- per litre from 2,109/- in May. Ewura said retail and wholesale prices for petrol and diesel imported through Tanga port have also increased compared to May prices due to increases in the world oil market prices and BPS premiums. However, kerosene prices in the Northern regions will remain unchanged because there was no new consignment of kerosene that was received through Tanga port in May, it said. For June retail prices of petrol and diesel for the Northern regions have increased by 105/- per litre (equivalent to 4.62 per cent) and 65/- per litre (equivalent to 2.92 per cent), respectively. For Arusha and Arumeru, retail prices for petrol have gone to 2,446/- per litre in June from 2,341/- in May while diesel prices have increased to 2,359/- per litre from 2,294/- in May and kerosene will be sold at 2,286/- per litre from 2,286/- in May. Ewura said retail and wholesale prices for diesel imported through Mtwara port have also increased compared to prices that were published on 1st May 2019. Petrol prices in the Southern regions shall remain unchanged because there was no new consignment of petrol that was received through Mtwara port in May, it said showing petrol prices for Mtwara will remain at 2,299/- per litre. For June retail prices of diesel for the Southern regions have increased by 64/- per litre (equivalent to 2.84 per cent increase) where cap prices in Mtwara rose to 2,319/- per litre from 2,254/- per litre in May. The increase in local prices of diesel imported through Mtwara port is mainly due to the increase in the world oil market prices and BPS premiums, it said. Kerosene prices in Mtwara has also gone up to 2,252/- per litre from 2,182/- per litre in May as it would be bought from Dar es Salaam since there is no kerosene at Mtwara storage terminals. “Since there is no Kerosene at Mtwara storage terminals, Petrol Station Operators in Mtwara, Lindi and Ruvuma regions are advised to source the product from Dar es Salaam,” said ewura.
