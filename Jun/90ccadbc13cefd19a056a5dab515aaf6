THE Premier League’s newcomers Polisi Tanzania have promoted their team’s Head Coach Ali Mtuli to the rank of a Technical Director with immediate effect. This was revealed by Polisi Tanzania Communication Officer Frank Lukwaro who said the changes at the technical bench have been made to ensure that the team gets good results in the coming league season. He, however, chose to remain mute when asked who will be the new coach at the helm of the club insisting that when all procedures are over, Mtuli’s successor will be named. Lukwaro said the management saw it necessary to have the Technical Director post saying it is essential in football bearing in mind that they will have a busy schedule next term to make sure that they bring desirable competition in the league. “Mtuli is experienced coach who now trades as Assistant Coach of Zanzibar national football team and has coached Zanzibar Police team for nearly seven years,” he said. He added that Mtuli will work abreast with other technical bench staff as one way to sharpen both the senior and junior team (U-20) simultaneously. In another development, Lukwaro said that they have started signing new players who will be able to withstand league pressure. “We are investing much in young players who will be able to offer their services at the club for a long time and this week, renovation starts at our training ground located at Tanzania Police School in Moshi, Kilimanjaro Region,” Lukwaro disclosed. The Moshi based team won the ticket to play in the top flight league after finishing top in their group B with 4 7 points after 22 matches, five points clear above second placed Pamba FC who garnered 42 points from the same number of clashes. They joined Namungo FC who also sailed into the senior league automatically without entertaining playoffs and the two teams have since vowed to do wonders in the upcoming season.
