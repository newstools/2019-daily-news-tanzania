THE Prime Minister’s Office in collaboration with the Ministry of Home Affairs is expected to issue a statement in the next two days on steps to be instituted against employers of trucks drivers who have no employment contracts. This was revealed by Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office, Anthony Mavunde when fielding a question from Tunduma MP, Frank Mwakajoka (CHADEMA). In his question, the opposition MP revealed that many drivers were operating without employment contracts. “The government pledged to work on an employment contract for drivers that has been existing since 2015, I want to know what the government is doing to expedite this matter so that the drivers can discharge their duties legally,’’ he said. In his response, MrMavunde said the government will come up with a strategic plan which will compel all bus owners to occupy operational licenses from Surface and Marine Transport Regulatory Authority (SUMATRA), as well as submitting contracts for their drivers. “Our strategy is to ensure that every driver occupies a working contract as per the Employment and Labor Relations Act as well as ensuring every truck owner follows the requirements of his license. “I want to assure this House that we are very serious, and beginning July 1, police officers will initiate a countrywide operation to crack the whip against all defaulters,’’ he said. In his main question, MrMwakajokawanted to know when the government will ensure that it intensifies supervision on truck drivers so as to protect their interests and increase efficiency in their operations. In his response, the deputy minister said that in ensuring that the drivers interests were protected on May 02, 2015 when the then Prime Minister, Mizengo Pinda proposed that the government should form a special committee to deal with the transport sector which should be chaired by the Permanent Secretary responsible for Transport.
