SCORES of key agricultural sector stakeholders are converging in Dodoma to discuss on the people-based budget planning in the agricultural sector. Speaking at the meeting, the Head of Advocacy at Oxfam, Ms Victoria Lihiru, said the meeting brings together policy makers and stakeholders. She pointed out that for a long time, they had been advocating for a huge budget in the agricultural sector but the feedback was not good enough. “We have therefore decided to convene a meeting with policy makers to get common understanding on people-based budget planning in the agricultural sector,” said Ms Lihiru. She noted that the sector was vital in economic growth because it employed 65 per cent of people in the country. Ms Lihiru observed that in order to attain the government’s goal of attaining industrial economy status, the agricultural sector should get a budget increase. She said farming was producing raw materials for industries, adding that it facilitates to uplift the livelihoods of people, mainly farmers and business people. On his part, Budget Analysis Coordinator from Agriculture Non-State Actors Forum (ANSAF), Mr Joseph Nyamboha, urged the government to focus on irrigation farming as part of climate change adaptation. Mr Nyamboha said majority of farmers in the country were still relying on rain fed agriculture, saying the reliance posed a challenge during the last rain season when most parts of the country experienced short durations of rainfall. “If the government will place more emphasis on irrigation farming, food shortage will remain history in the country,” he said.
