TANZANIA Swimming Association (TSA) urgently needs over 120m/- to foot the national swimming team’s participation in the two world events later next month. The home swimmers are set to compete in the World Swimming Championships to be staged in Gwangju, South Korea from July 12th to 28th and in the Junior World Championships to be staged in Budapest, Hungary from August 20 to 25th. This was revealed by TSA Secretary General, Inviolata Itatiro yesterday who said the country is expected to deploy four swimmers in the first assignment and seven athletes in the second mission. She named the swimmers as Hilal Hemed Hilal and Collins Saliboko in men’s category while Caloiaro and Shivani Bhatt will do their part in the female pack. “The team which is heading to Korea will be under Head Coach Alexander Mwaipasi together with TSA Chairperson Imani Alimanya and Vice-Chairperson Asma Hilal who will, among other things, attend a high level meeting dubbed Fina Congress,” Itatiro said. She then unveiled swimmers readying to compete in junior event as Dennis Mhini, Delvin Barick, Christopher Fitzpatrick, Christian Shirima and Isam Sepetu who will compete in boys’ category while Kayla Temba and Laila Rashid will trade in girls’ pack. According to her, the association needs to raise about 39m/- for the South Korea mission while 81m/- is needed for the Budapest trip to be effectively accomplished. “At the moment, TSA alone cannot manage to cater for all the expenses demanded to transport the team to the named destinations as such, let me request for financial assistance from those who are willing to give us a helping hand,” said Itatiro.
