Police in Morogoro Region are holding three people for questioning in connection with the killing of a Chama cha Demokrasia na maendeleo (CHADEMA) cadre, Regional Police Commander (RPC) Wilbrod Mtafungwa has said. The RPC named the trio arrested on Thursday as Francis Mwanampalu, Memori Mbegalo and the third one only identified as Robson, all residents of same Munga village. He said the people were alleged to have murdered Lucas Lihambalimo (42), a resident of Munga village in Malinyi District, Morogoro Region, where he was also the District’s Chadema Secretary of Ideology and Publicity. He said initial investigations showed that Lihambalimo was wounded in his head by what was suspected to be a bullet shot from a homemade gun. The RPC further said that their investigation established that the deceased had a land dispute with Mwanampalu, a factor that might have caused his death. Narrating the scene he said that the incident followed when Lihambalimo and his wife Zaituni Matandiko (42) had a chance to see Mwanampalu in a company of some two people and on opening his door, he was shot on the head and subsequently died as a result of excessive loss of blood. The RPC further said that the deceased’s wife cried for help, and that prompted their neighbours to rush to the scene and take Lihambalimo to their nearby health centre, however he died later on while undergoing treatment. “Police in collaboration with wananchi launched a man hunt that led to the arrest of three accused persons, who would be arraigned before the court of law when investigations are complete,” he pointed out.
