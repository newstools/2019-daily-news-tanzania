SPEAKER of the National Assembly Job Ndugai has informed in writing the chairman of the National Electoral that Singida East Constituency led by Mr Tundu Lissu (Chadema) is vacant. The decision came after Mr Lissu failed to attend parliamentary meetings without informing him and violating the Constitution by failing to submit Assets and Liabilities Declaration Forms to the Ethics Secretariat. Mr Lissu is undergoing treatment in Belgium following several gunshots he sustained while in Dodoma in September 2017 as he was heading home from Parliament. Mr Ndugai told the House that he had written to NEC Chairman Judge Semistocles Kaijage, informing him that Singida East Constituency was vacant. Speaking in Parliament after Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa had adjourned the parliamentary budget session, Mr Ndugai said Section 71(1)(c) of the Constitution directed that a Member of Parliament shall lose his/her seat if he/she missed three consecutive parliamentary sittings without permission from the Speaker. “We have been witnessing the Singida East MP, who claims that he is sick, making several media tours and attending various meetings abroad and I do not have any information regarding his whereabouts. Neither has he informed me about how he is progressing with treatment and above all, his party has yet to issue any information to my office,’’ he said. The second reason, according to the Speaker, the lawmaker was yet to sign and submit the assets and liabilities declaration forms for over two years now contrary to legislation.
