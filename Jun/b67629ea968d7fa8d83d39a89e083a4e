PRIVATE sector players now want the government to offer them all construction projects’ tenders following the recent President John Magufuli’s statement, and vow that before his tenure ends he expects to see over 100 billionaires in Tanzania. The appeal was made in Dar es Salaam yesterday by Tanzania Private Sector Foundation (TPSF), Chairman Mr Salum Shamte, in a meeting of the Energy Ministry and industrialists organized to hear both parties’ grievances and challenges, where he further asked the Ministry to give them all tenders to construct power generation projects in the country. “The President recently vowed that he wants to produce 100 billionaires during his leadership...the government has many opportunities to realize this, we think that by giving all tenders to local contractors was one of them,” pointed the Chairman. The Foundation further asked the Energy Minister, Dr Medard Kalemani to consider their plea and discuss it at the ministry level. He said that should the government offer them the tenders they would collaborate with foreign contractors as their employees. “Let those billions of money remain in Tanzania, no need to announce tenders abroad,” he said. It was expected that the after the meeting, the ministry would get a clear picture on where to intervene, while addressing challenges to improve their service to the manufacturers, especially on energy tap. The TPSF believes that through such meetings, their members would face no major hurdles as the President has been pointed out that discussion with stakeholders was necessary. Expounding, Mr Shamte cited power interruptions as one of the major challenges they face from the ministry. He said the problem, in some parts was a result of poor power infrastructures including old electric poles being in the public and normally fall without immediate replacement.
