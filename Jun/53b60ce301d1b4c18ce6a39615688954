MWADUI FC hitman Salum Aiyee said he is yet to decide which team to play for next season, despite having seven offers from different clubs on his table. Aiyee, whose contract with the Shinyanga based team has expired, scored 18 goals to his account last season making him the top goal scorer among domestic players during the past Mainland Premier League season. Mwadui survived the relegation wrath courtesy of their 2-1 playoff win over Geita Gold in a tight match held at Mwadui Complex in Shinyanga. It was Aiyee, who netted a brace on the day to save the sinking ship for his side which guaranteed them a slot in the 20-team league for the incoming term. Aiyee said recently that he is still going through the available offers before picking the best team for him. “I have seven offers from different teams here in Tanzanian. Until now, I have not yet selected my next destination as to whether I will remain here or not,” he said. He said of all the goals he scored last season, the last grasp goal he netted against Geita Gold is the one he will always remember in his career. “As you know, we were the first to score on that day but the visitors cancelled the lead to make it 1-1 which made the match very tough because if it ended like that, definitely, we could have been relegated,” Aiyee said. He added: “To score that vital goal during the injury time was very important for me and the whole team.” Commenting on why he is not included in the national team despite being sharp on the target, Aiyee said selection of which player to be included in the squad is done by the Head Coach as such, when time comes, he will take the chance. “I am available when they want my service. Tanzania has many good players and I am sure that those who are with the national team will do a great job for the country,” said him. He then lauded good cooperation from his teammates which enabled him to emerge top scorer for his squad and vowed to continue firing more goals come next season.
