BOXING, once of the country’s major medal hope, seeks spectacular comeback as it was disclosed recently by the sport’s innovators; Ngome Club of Dar es Salaam. Olympian Selemani Kidunda from Ngome said yesterday that boxing, a sport that has lost its former stronghold needs extra creativity to make it strong and well capable of appealing sponsors. He said by staging the pro-am boxing bouts that engaged the ring amateur, professional and kick boxers, was among innovative moves his club has taken. Kidunda said the aim was to attract all three topes of boxing fans and it worked well. The boxing gala that involved professional and amateur boxers was staged at TPDF 361 Club in Mwenge under backing of Smart Gin. Nassibu Ramadhani who defeated Muhammed Kashinde on technical knockout (T-KO) in the first of the sixround bout said the event was well organised and well attended too. “It was a good day and fans enjoyed it, saw a new era of boxing coming back to Tanzania on the day,” said the winner. Also thrilled boxing fans at the venue was the kickboxing bout between Jeremia Jackson and Hashimu Masungo and the former emerged the winner on split points decision. Pugilist Kaisi Ally defeated Hamis Mohamed on technical knockout before Selemani Kidunda using his experience to knock out Daniel Ilankanda in a thrilling bout. Ismail Galiatano of Ngome defeated Swaibu Ramadhani of JKT on points decision while Steven Anastaz of Ngome also beat Iddi Athumani of JKT by point decision. The event was bankrolled by Smart Gin whose representative, Peter Kinabo promised to continue sponsoring boxing events because he was thrilled by the way the Pro-Am Boxing event was organised. “I have seen both; talents and skills beside the good organisation of the whole event. My firm will continue supporting boxing to ensure it regains its lost glory,” he said.
