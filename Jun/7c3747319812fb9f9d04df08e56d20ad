THIRD Year students undertaking Bachelor of Science in Physics at the University of Dodoma (Udom), have developed a monitoring of aquaculture system device to facilitate fish farming. They told ‘Daily News’ during a just ended exhibition of vocational training institutions at Jamhuri Stadium that the device could automatically send information through SMS to a fish farmer’s mobile phone on the state of fish pond. “A fish farmer can use his or her mobile phone connected with a system to control the level of water in fish pond,” said Mr John Bosco Kessy, the team leader of Udom students, who implemented the project to develop the device during an interview with this newspaper. The event, organised by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, brought together vocational training and tertiary institutions from across the country to showcase their goods and services Mr Kessy noted that the device would help a fish farmer enhance the fish welfare and boost the economy of fish farm. He pointed out other benefits as measuring fish biomass index and growth, detecting feed waste, understanding fish distribution and activity. “We came up with the idea to develop a monitoring of aquaculture system after realising a good number of challenges facing fish farmers in monitoring of fish pond,” Mr Kessy observed. Deputy Minister for Education, Science and Technology William Ole Nasha, speaking during the closing of the event, said the weeklong exhibition had provided students with an ideal platform to showcase their invention. “The event has also given an opportunity to members of the public to know goods and services offered by various institutions in the country,” he said.
