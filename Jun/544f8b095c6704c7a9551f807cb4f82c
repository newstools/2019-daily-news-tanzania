The East African Community ( EAC) Ministerial Session of the 14th meeting of the Sectoral Council on Energy had to be called off on Friday due to lack of quorum. The Rules of Procedure for the Council of Ministers provide that quorum of the meeting of the Council is all Partner States’ representation. The representation at the Ministerial Session of the Council requires a Minister or Ministers designated by that Partner State. However, when the meeting convened at the EAC headquarters on Friday, it was realized that responsible ministers from Rwanda and South Sudan had been missing in the conference room. The move compelled the organizers to call off the crucial meeting until further notice. “The Secretariat is consulting with the Partner States on when to convene the Ministerial Session, either by video conferencing or face to face meeting,” said a statement released by the EAC’s Corporate Communications and Public Affairs Department. Among other things, the meeting sought to review the progress made in the sector in implementing the decisions of the Council, receive updates on energy sector activities from the Partner States and consider other issues of regional importance. It also entailed at considering the status of implementation of the previous directives and decisions of the Sectoral Council, the Implementation of Regional Strategy on Scaling Up Access to Modern Energy Services; Consideration of implementation of East African Power Master Plan projects, and; Consideration of a report on enhancement of a sustainable regional energy market in Eastern Africa, Southern Africa and Indian Ocean region project. Other items on the agenda of the five-day Sectoral Council included the consideration of the Centre of Excellence for the East African Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (EACREEE) report, consideration of the study on analysis of petroleum policies, legal and regulatory frameworks in the region report.
