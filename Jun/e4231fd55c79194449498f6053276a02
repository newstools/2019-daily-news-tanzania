Mimi na Wewe Foundation, is the name of the organisation that has offered a 100 per cent sponsorship to two former Taifa Stars players, according to report unveiled yesterday by the President of Zanzibar Football Federation, Seif Kombo Pandu. Pandu said the foundation has rewarded the sponsorship to the two players as recognition for their contribution in developing football in the Isles and Tanzania as a whole. “They deserve respect and honour for what they have done to the Isles football. They have done a lot and we must honour them,” said Pandu. The two former players will stay in Egypt for ten days under the foundation sponsorship. “However, they must stay more than ten days if our national team manages to advance to the higher stages.
