THE government has commended Exim Bank Tanzania for contribution to the success of blood donation initiatives in the country as Tanzania joined the rest of the world in celebrating World Blood Donor Day Last Friday. The bank received a trophy shield of recognition for its milestone donations to the National Blood Programme during this year’s commemorations held nationally at Furahisha grounds located in Mwanza City over the weekend. The theme of this year’s campaign was “Safe blood for all”. The Minister for Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, Ummy Mwalimu (MP) who was the Guest of Honour, urged the bank to continue being the country’s blood ambassador and to inspire many more institutions and individuals to join the lifesaving mission. “The government has allocated 5.0bn/- in the fiscal year 2019/20 which will be used to build five small blood donation camps in 12 regions in across the country,’’ she said while using the same occasion to launch brand new ‘full automation’ blood testing machines installed in six zonal camps including Dar es Salaam, Mwanza, Tabora, Kilimanjaro, Mtwara and Mbeya. “I want to call upon all people who fall under the age bracket of blood donors and are in good health to heed to the call and see that we deal with blood shortages and save lives of vulnerable people who require blood transfusions. We are able and can meet the country blood targets, we just have to work hard and improve public perceptions and attitude towards donating blood,” she added.
