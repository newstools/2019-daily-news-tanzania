THE Water ministry plans to introduce a special programme for its engineers to get capacity building training to improve their performance, in a bid to bring about transformation in the sector. Its Permanent Secretary, Prof Kitila Mkumbo, told executives from the Department of Water Supply and Sanitation (DWSS) at a meeting during Public Service Week that the training was vital for improving performance. “We have developed a system for enhancing capacity amongst our engineers in order to improve their performance. We want to have best engineers in the sector who will oversee water projects,” said the PS. The annual event provides ministries, public institutions and government agencies a platform to showcase their services to members of the public. Prof Mkumbo explained that the special programme would also support fresh engineers to get registration in the Engineers Registration Board (ERB), pledging major transformation in the water sector under the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Authority (RUWASA) which becomes operational on July 1. Delivering a vote of thanks, the Director of Water Supply and Sanitation, Engineer Nadhifa Kemikimba, said workers in the Department of Water Supply and Sanitation should work hard because their department embodied the goals and vision of the ministry. Engineer Kemikimba said the aim of the meeting was to establish the challenges facing them in order to seek ways of addressing them.
