CLIENTS of the Tanzania Agricultural Development Bank (TADB) have praised President John Magufuli’s call on the institution to open regional branches in order to be close to farmers, the prospective borrowers. The President made the call when he met members of the business community at the State House in Dar es Salaam last weekend. Contacted for comment on clients’ views, the TADB Managing Director, Mr Japhet Justine, said the bank was seriously working on the call because, he said, Kigoma, Mwanza and Dodoma offices were already operational. “We appreciate and welcome the views of your interviewees. We are working on the call by the President because our ambition has always been to be understood by our clients and offer them best services and products,” he said. Mr Justine explained that the Mwanza office that serves Mwanza, Mara, Shinyanga, Simiyu, Geita and Kagera regions, was opened by Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa on March 19, 2019. The Dodoma office has been operational since last year and the Kigoma office has been operational for the nine months. He said another office will be opened in Mbeya city to serve Mbeya, Songwe, Njombe, Iringa and Ruvuma regions. In an interview, the clients said having TADB regional offices countrywide would cut down costs on the part of applicants and there would be person- to-person consultations. Plus, the bank’s products will be known to many people and conditions for getting loans will be known to them as well. The interviewees also praised the bank’s performance, saying it had proved its worth in less than one year. Mr Anangisye Mwakalindile, a Rungwe District avocado farmer, said during the meeting at the State House it became evident that the President had faith in TADB’s performance, hence his call to ensure it opens branches at regional level..
