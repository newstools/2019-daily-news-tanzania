AVIATION stakeholders have been challenged to invest in cargo airlines amid increased exports as transformation from agricultural led economy to semi-industrial economy gains momentum. The Minister for Works Transport and Communications Isack Kamwelwe revealed that around 200 tonnes of fish are exported to the Europe and Asian markets on the daily basis but the carriage works were done by foreign airlines through Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and Entebbe Airport with limited benefits to Tanzanians. Mr Kamwelwe who was speaking during the second aviation forum organised by the Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority (TCAA) in Dar es Salaam said there were meat processing plants in final stages of construction which will boost exports. On what the government has done to boost food stuff exports, the minister said that it has built cold rooms at Songwe and Mwanza airports and soon there will be one at Julius Nyerere International Airport which will facilitate exports of horticultural products. The two day forum, with the theme; “taking aviation industry in Tanzania to the apex” brought together private and public aviation stakeholders in the country to brainstorm or arising opportunities and challenges as the sector grows inline with the industrialisation agenda in the country. The Chief Executive Director of the revived national airline Air Tanzania Company Limited (ATCL) Ladislaus Matindi said that he had welcomed the Minister’s advice and that it will be worked upon after intensive business researches are conducted so as to make the right decision.
