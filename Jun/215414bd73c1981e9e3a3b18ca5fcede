THE John Akhwari Marathon which was staged here yesterday saw the once powerful Kenyan runners losing their energy after being overpowered by Tanzanians in the 21km half marathon race. Tanzanian Emmanuel G iniki was the local hero yesterday after winning the inaugural John Steven Akhwari Marathon in 1hour, 01 minute and 50 seconds, ahead of his fellow Tanzanian Stephano Uche who clocked 1hour, 03 minutes and 4 7 seconds to finish the overall runner up. Michael Joseph from Singida finished third after clocking 1 hour, 03 minutes and 50 seconds. Kenyans eventually managed to make their collars’ felt in the fourth position through Abraham Too who raced in 1 hour, 4 minutes and 51 seconds. Another Kenyan, Wilfred Kempoyo who spent one hour, five minutes and three seconds on the road, took the fifth position. He however managed to beat the winning entry in the female runners’ category, if it is any consolation. In ladies categories, it was another Tanzanian Failuna Abdi Matanga who clinched the diadem after spending 1 hour 12 minutes and 20 seconds. The second position was taken by Judith Cherolo from Kenya who covered the distance in 1 hour 13 minutes and 49 seconds, while Magdalene Chrispin from the Tanzania People’s Defence Forces finished in the fourth position. The Minister of Information, Culture and Sports, Harrison Mwakyembe, who graced the occasion, said effective from the coming year, 2020 the John Akhwari race will become a full marathon to cover 42 kilometres distance, thus athletics should be prepared. Race organiser, Sylvester Orao said a total of 700 athletes participated in the maiden marathon, with the first winners pocketing 800,000/- each; second winners 600,000/-, third winners 450,000/-, fourth winners 250,000/- the fifth winners 200,000/- the sixth 170,000/- and the seventh 150,000/-. Few people know John Akhwari, the former National Marathon Runner, who represented Tanzania in the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico and managed to complete the race despite badly injuring his leg. Akhwari coined the golden quote; “My country did not send me 5000 miles away to start the race; they sent me to finish it!” The ace legendary runner repeated the same immortal line during a press conference held in Arusha on Friday. Born in 1938, Mzee John Stephen Akhwari who participated in the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico was only 30 when he dislocated his knee during the race, but still continued to limp his way to the finishing line. Aged 81 years, Mzee Akwari is still strong; “I was the first Tanzanian athlete to open the curtains into international marathon events, and this race being organised in my honour should encourage young people to take bold steps into similar sporting expeditions regardless of their backgrounds or capabilities,” he said.
