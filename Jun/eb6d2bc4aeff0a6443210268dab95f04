THE multi-million-shillings Dodoma City Complex is set to be built along UDOM Road by the city council, as one of the revenue boosting strategies. Dodoma City Council Director, Mr Godwin Kunambi, told a recent city council meeting that the four-storey building would host a wide variety of business, including supermarkets, restaurants, banks and offices. “The complex is part of our seven strategic projects to be finalised by 2025 in order to create new sources of revenue,” said the director while addressing the ward councillors. Mr Kunambi said plans were underway for the Dodoma City Council to sign an agreement with a contractor who will start undertaking two initial projects before July 5 - Dodoma City Hotel and Government City Complex. He cited other strategic projects which are underway as Nyerere Square Plaza near the famous Nyerere Square in Dodoma downtown, Nunge Investment and Dodoma City Plaza which will replace NK Hall along Jamatini Street. Mr Kunambi said the projects would create employment opportunities and boost the city council’s revenue, adding that the buildings would give the city a new, more pleasant face.
