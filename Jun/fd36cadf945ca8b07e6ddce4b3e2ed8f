WATER Minister, Prof Makame Mbarawa, has ordered a contractor, China Railway Seventh Group (CRSG), which is undertaking the Ntomoko water project in Kondoa District in Dodoma Region to speed it up. He gave the order during an inspection tour of the mega project in Busi Village in Kondoa over the weekend, pointing out that the 12-month project should be completed within six months. “One year is too long; people need water. If the disbursement is done on time, only six months are enough to complete this project. We will ensure the disbursement is done on time so as to fast track implementation,” the minister remarked. Prof Mbarawa was accompanied by the Dodoma Urban Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DUWASA) Managing Director, Engineer David Pallangyo, whose authority is supervising the 2.26bn/- project. Briefing the minister, DUWASA Technical Manager Kashilimu Mayunga pointed out that major features of the project would include the construction of water supply infrastructure to replace the old ones. He added that the project would also involve construction of water tanks with storage capacity of between 45,000 and 90,000 litres in Makirinya, Lusangi and Kinkima villages and installation of a solar power panel system in Ntomoko- Fai village. Mr Mayunga said about 21,000 people will benefit from water supply services in Makirinya, Kiere- Chang’ombe, Lusangi, Kinkima, Churuku, Jinjo, Jangalo, Hamai and Songolo villages in Kondoa and Chemba districts. He explained that the construction will facilitate extension of water service supply to four more villages - Makirinya and Ntomoko in Kondoa District and Lusangi and Kinkima in Chemba District. Chemba District Council Water Engineer Robert Mganga said the reluctance by some people to pay for water supply services was a major challenge. “Some people declare that water supply is a right for which they are entitled free of charge,” he said.
