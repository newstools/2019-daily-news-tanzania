STUDENTS from higher learning institutions have been advised to engage themselves in other economic activities to earn extra incomes as they pursue their academic dreams. Speaking in an interview with the Daily News here yesterday, Chairperson of Beekeeping Club from the University of Dodoma (UDOM) Rajab Mdaki said economic activities were vital in helping students to earn income while at campuses. He argued that the university decided to establish the club after realising that many students were dropping out of school due to financial hiccups. “We were tired of seeing many students leaving classes because they had no food allowances and worse enough, some girls were engaging themselves in prostitution to get money for their basic needs,” said Mr Mdaki. He said after initiating the club, members visited former Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda and Central Park Company and received honey for sale and after finishing the consignment, they surrendered the principal money to the honey producers and remained with profit, which they later used as capital. Mr Mdaki said since its establishment in June 2017, the club has helped many students especially those who could not afford buying food while at the university. “We started by identifying opportunities in sectors that are not highly prioritised like beekeeping and we are glad that our club has 150 members,’’ he said.
