AFTER years of poor production in coconut fruits which led to heavy reliance of imports from Tanga in the mainland and Mombasa in Kenya, Zanzibar has launched fresh campaigns to get back to being one of the leading producers of coconut in the region. The Minister for Agriculture, Natural resources, Livestock and Fisheries, Mr Mmanga Mjengo Mjawir informed the House here that already his office is producing coconut seedlings to be distributed to farmers. More than 86,000 seedlings have been produced and given to farmers, he said. “We ask farmers to clean their farms, do away with old coconut trees by planting new ones. The ‘East African Tall’ species is our choice,” the Minister said, adding that the government is fully committed in reviving coconut trade. Some backbenchers such as Mr Ali Suleiman Ali a.k.a ‘Shihata’ from Kijitoupele constituency observed that decline of coconut production in recent years is linked to the government’s sluggishness is dealing with the famous crop. The legislators said that there is huge possibility for Zanzibar to improve and produce more coconut for home consumption and export and for processing. Slow planting of new coconut trees, cutting down wood and land clearance for construction have been widely blamed for the coconut decline, but the government is already taking measures to stop unauthorized cutting of coconut trees.
