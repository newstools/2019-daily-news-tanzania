MOTIVATING local companies through recognising their contribution towards the society is vital in boosting their performance. This was said yesterday in Dar es Salaam by the Chairman and Managing Director of Motisun Group, Subhash Patel during a special event to award best companies in East Africa. Mr Patel said that by motivating local companies, it helps in making them more active and more concerned with the society around them, which in turn will increase their contribution towards their Corporate Social Responsibility. He said that the award ceremony which is being held in Tanzania for the first time has brought together over 90 companies from the East African bloc, which saw local companies competing with neighbouring companies. “I am happy that this award ceremony is being held in our backyard, which will help us to notice any shortcomings and how to improve in taking value of our own employees and the society at large,” he said. Making the country proud through the process, Kilimanjaro SAR Limited of Tanzania managed to get rid of the stiff competition and grabbed the overall winner award. Officiating over the event, Dr R. L Bhatia, the Chief Editor and Founder of World CSR Day said that for a company to become a leader it needs to empower people and create future leaders. “To be a leader, it means that you are leading people somewhere where they cannot go on their own and this event is meant to create more leaders in the African continent,” he said.
