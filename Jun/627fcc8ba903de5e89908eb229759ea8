THE government has been commended for its positive reforms in the 2019/20 national budget but has been advised to consider investing in soft infrastructure equally with hard infrastructure. An economist from the University of Mzumbe, Professor Honest Ngowi made the remarks in Dar es Salaam yesterday during a budget dinner organized by KPMG Tanzania to analyse the latest budget. Prof Ngowi said the budget was heavy on traditional, hard or orthodox infrastructure that includes roads, ports, airport and railways but nothing had been set aside for soft infrastructure which includes information and communication technology. “Soft infrastructure is very important in enabling knowledge economy, including electronic commerce; among issues of discussion in this docket include the quantity and quality of infrastructure. This is very important in a country with a relatively huge infrastructure deficit as Tanzania,” he noted. He said the country needs to consider investing in things like the speed of the internet as things transferred online might be more valuable than the ones in the ports. On the issue of local content, he said that includes the extent to which Tanzanians are involved actively and meaningfully in executing various projects. This includes the extent to which local firms are actually contracted and/or subcontracted in implementing them. Elaborating, he said on the issue of revenue collection, there was a need to increase the tax base especially as a lot of businesses were currently suffering. “The government should not use tax as a tool of revenue collection, but rather, a tool for development,” he said. KPMG Tanzania Associate Director, Mr Nsanyiwa Donald, said they anticipated a lot of changes in the budget, including formalising the informal sector. Mr Donald said compared with neighbouring countries, Kenya was already thinking of taxing digital economy, a move from which Tanzania had to borrow a leaf.
