EAST African Community (EAC) has unveiled its 111 million US dollar (over 255bn/-) budget for the 2019/20 fiscal year. The budget, which was tabled before the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA) here, has its priorities, like Tanzania’s national, on industrialisation and job creation. The budget was tabled here barely a week after partner states presented their respective national budgets. The EAC presented for consideration, the 111,450,529 dollar budget estimates. Tanzania’s Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation Dr Damas Ndumbaro presented the budget on behalf of the EAC Council of Ministers Chairperson and Rwanda’s Minister of State, EAC, in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Ambassador Olivier Nduhungirehe. The 2019/2020 budget is themed ‘Transforming lives through industrialisation and job creation for shared prosperity.’ According to the Council of Ministers Chairperson, the priority interventions for the 2019/2020 financial year will be on consolidation of the Single Customs Territory and promotion of intra and extra EAC trade and export competitiveness. It also looks on development of regional infrastructure, effective implementation of the Common Market Protocol and enhancement of regional industrial development. Other areas include implementation of the roadmap towards the EAC monetary union, institutional transformation focusing on implementation of the institutional review recommendations and improvement of performance management at the EAC organs and institutions. The council chairperson proposed that the 2019/2020 budget be allocated to the organs and institutions of the EAC, with the EAC Secretariat getting 53,296,404 dollars; EALA allocated 18,973,845 dollars and the East African Court of Justice given 4,225,241 dollars. Other institutions with their allocations in brackets are the Inter-University Council for East Africa (9,586,426 dollars), Lake Victoria Basin Commission (13,193,849 dollars) and Lake Victoria Fisheries Organisation (4,061,145 dollars). Others are East African Science and Technology Commission (1,915,073 dollars), East African Kiswahili Commission (1,474,775 dollars) and East African Health Research Commission (3,996,270 dollars). The East African Competition Authority, the budget proposes, will get 727,501 dollars in the coming fiscal year. The EAC partner states will finance the 2019/2020 budget through contributions by the ministries of EAC affairs (49,791,446 dollars), ministries responsible for education (4,379,968 dollars) and ministries responsible for fisheries (2,060,845 dollars). Development partners will support the community with 54,031,725 US dollars while member universities will inject in 468,300 dollars. The miscellaneous revenue is pegged at 296,145 dollars while the general reserve will contribute 422,100 dollars. Dr Ndumbaro said other key areas include promotion of peace, security and good governance as well as the constitution making process for the EAC political confederation, the factors he described as necessary for successful implementation of socioeconomic programmes to further support EAC regional growth and development. The EAC is further expected to streamline and consolidate its operational systems to achieve the desired level of efficiency, accountability and value for money. The council of ministers chairperson cited a number of assumptions on which the budget proposals are pegged, including the continued and consolidated political support of the EAC integration and availability of adequate financial resources and remittances. Political stability and good governance as well as safe and stable security across the region are other areas of consideration. In this financial year, the house approved the 111, 933,303 dollar budget. The amount was earmarked for, among other things, consolidation of the Single Customs Territory (SCT) to cover all imports and intra-EAC traded goods; infrastructural development in the region and liberalisation of free movement of skilled labour across the partner states. On the global economic performance outlook, the minister informed the house that the global economy had expanded and the EAC region had maintained its position as the fastest growing economic bloc. “Mr Speaker, given the accelerated growth within Sub-Saharan Africa, thanks to strong agricultural production, rapid public investment and private consumption in the past two years, the EAC region has maintained its position as the fastest growing sub-region in Africa, with estimated growth of 6.3 per cent in 2018, up from a revised growth of 5.6 per cent in 2017. “Strong growth was widespread in the region, with Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda growing at over six per cent. Economic growth in Burundi and South Sudan remained subdued in 2018, with some strong signs of recovery. GDP growth in Burundi was 0.1 per cent in 2018 compared with a contraction of about 1.3 per cent in 2017. In South Sudan, the economy contracted by 1.2 per cent in 2018 compared to a contraction of 3.5 per cent in 2017,” Dr Ndumbaro said.
