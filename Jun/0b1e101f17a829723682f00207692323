THE government says it has been taking stringent measures to ensure that all widows in the country are economically stable, while ensuring that they don’t land into extreme poverty after losing their husbands. Deputy Minister for Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, Dr Faustine Ndugulile, said here yesterday that the government was ensuring that the widows were joining various economic groups that make them self-independent. He was speaking during the commemoration of the International Widow’s Day which was held at the famous Mwalimu Nyerere Grounds in Dodoma, popularly known as Nyerere Square. The United Nations observes 23 June as International Widows Day, to draw attention to the voices and experiences of widows and to galvanize the unique support that they need. The loss of a partner is devastating. For many women around the world, that loss is magnified by a long-term struggle for basic needs, their human rights and dignity. They may be denied inheritance rights to the piece of land that they relied on for livelihood or evicted from their homes, forced into unwanted marriages or traumatizing widowhood rituals. They are stigmatized for life, shunned and shamed. And, many of these abuses go unnoticed, even normalized. There are an estimated 258 million widows around the world and nearly one in ten live in extreme poverty. As women, they have specific needs, but their voices and experiences are often absent from policies that impact their survival. According to the deputy minister, there was a total of 918 economic groups comprising 10,708 women, among them the widows, since the government started to implement the plan. “The government, through Local Government Authorities (LGAs) decided that every LGA should allocate 10per cent of its internal revenue for women’s empowerment,” said Dr Ndugulile.
