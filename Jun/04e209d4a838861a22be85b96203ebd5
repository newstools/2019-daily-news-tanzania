THE management of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA) plans to engage the private operators in order to increase volume of traffic both passengers and goods. This is one of the proposals made by the management during the meeting of TAZARA board comprising of permanent secretaries responsible for transport from Tanzania and Zambia together with four other board members from both countries over the weekend. “Engage more private operators in view of the good performance under the open access model so that the volume of traffic on TAZARA is increased further,” stated the statement noting that TAZARA owns a lot of valuable assets that are either lying idle or underutilized in most cases. The management was also directed to appoint a contracts manager to specifically manage contracts for the open access and the hire of locomotives from other railway operators. The meeting that approved the budget for the next fiscal year also considered and approved the proposal by management to transport 300,000 metric tonnes of freight and 800,000 passengers for the budget of the financial year 2019/20. The management was ordered to proceed with the proposal to enter into a Joint Venture with a private investor for the operation and management of TAZARA’s Mununga Quarry in Muchinga Province. Further to evaluate the possibility of embracing workable public-private-partnership models through which to finance the re-manufacture of idle locomotives and the development of idle land assets. “We considered and authorized management to proceed with the procurement of an induction furnace with all its accessories for production of spares, mill balls and other foundry related products in the Mpika Workshops,” said the statement
