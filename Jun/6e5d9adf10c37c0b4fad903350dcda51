THE Tanzania National Parks (Tanapa) is keen to conduct a thorough review of its policy and guidelines with a view to introducing reforms that are in line with the paramilitary system. Speaking here yesterday after commissioning 102 senior and Principal Conservation Rangers, the authority’s Conservation Commissioner Dr Allan Kijazi pointed out that it was important for the parastatal charged with the country’s national parks management to review its structures to assume the new system. Dr Kijazi further said that some of the staff could be affected by the sudden shift of operations and hence appealed for calm as the authority departs from a parastatal into paramilitary in a bid to reinforce anti-poaching battle. “I urge you to take such changes positively, let me assure you that all your concerns would be taken on board. No one would be left behind in the reforms, because they would be per the government’s policy and regulations,” he noted.
