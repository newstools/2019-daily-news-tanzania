AT least twelve people have over the past week undergone endoscopic surgery, minimally invasive surgery (MIS), at Benjamin Mkapa Hospital (BMH), since the public health facility set up a special camp for endoscopic service on June 7. The endoscopic procedure or MIS, uses an endoscope to examine the interior of a hollow organ or cavity. Unlike many other medical imaging techniques, endoscopes are inserted directly into the organ. A gynecologist at BMH, Dr Januarus Hinju, said here yesterday that some 437 people turned out for the endoscopic service at BMH over the past one week, saying the camp has registered great achievement due to positive response from the people. “Several other patients have been arranged for endoscopic surgeries. BMH encourages more people who are seeking the service to make use of the service camp,” said the gynecologist. Dr Hinju pointed out here that medical experts at BMH have teamed up with their counterparts of USA to conduct a two weeks camp at the public facility. “Women with reproductive problems may start coming to BMH now for medical check-ups so that if found with serious problems, they undergo endoscopic surgery during the camp,” said the hospital’s gynecologist. BMH conducts the camp for endoscopy services for the second consecutive year after the one which was conducted last June. Dr Hinju noted that recovery time from endoscopic surgery or minimally invasive surgery (MIS) can be days instead of the weeks or months of the recovery compared to traditional open neurosurgery.
