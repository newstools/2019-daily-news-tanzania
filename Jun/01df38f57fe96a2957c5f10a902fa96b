THE National Institute of Transport (NIT), has encouraged more students to undertake various courses on sciences that will increase the number of experts and innovators necessary for driving up an industrial economy. An official with NIT, Mr Castory Njako made the remarks yesterday at the just started 43nd Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair taking place along Kilwa road. “NIT has introduced new courses on railway which are expected to commence soon, and it is an opportunity for more students to embark on,” he said while urging students to plan their time better on things necessary for the country’s development. The courses are relevant as the government is currently implementing mega projects on railway, including construction of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) and rehabilitation of the central railway line. This is an opportunity for students and the youth to pursue the courses as preparation in grabbing the immense opportunities in the mega projects.
