YOUNG Africans leadership has been urged to include some of the club’s former players in key decision making posts as one way to honour their contributions. This was said by the club’s former star Sunday Manara during the fundraising event held at the Diamond Jubilee Hall in Dar es Salaam over the weekend that aimed at sourcing funds to support the team ahead of the busy next season. Speaking on behalf of ex-players, who successfully traded at the club, Manara said time has come for the club leadership to incorporate former players in major decision making areas since they have a lot experience to contribute. “Let me urge this management to always seek advises from us (former players), because we have a lot to add for the purpose of driving further the team,” Manara said. He added that through respecting the retired players, the club can easily be propelled to the right direction for the best interest of the entire team, insisting that the same approach is used by other big teams which are making it big in the football circles. Manara also requested the leadership to give them free entry into the stadium in Yanga games as one way of recognising their massive contributions. “We served well the club for almost ten years and we are still required to pay to watch Yanga matches. This is not fair, as such, it can be wise to grant us free entry,” said Manara, who also played for the national team during his peak days. Additionally, he called on the club to go digital in order to go in line with demands of the new world, which has embraced digital a lot and leave behind old means. On a laughing note, Manara told Yanga members not to be derailed with what Simba SC Communication Officer, Haji Manara says about them. "He is my son, he is our son. Whatever he says, just know that he was raised in a Yanga family and not otherwise," he said as the packed hall sparked into cheers.
