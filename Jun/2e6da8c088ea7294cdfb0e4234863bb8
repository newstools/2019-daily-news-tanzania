STATE Minister in the President’s Office for Regional Administration and Local Government, Mr Selemani Jafo, has directed authorities in Dodoma to start construction the Uhuru Hospital construction project by next week. Uhuru Hospital will be built thanks to President John Magufuli’s move to cancel Independence Day celebrations last December for which 995m/-had been earmarked. The minister gave the directive here yesterday shortly after visiting Maduma Village in Chamwino District where Uhuru Hospital will be built, pointing out that the project should be completed within six months. “The project should be carried out by one of our forces and the contractors should use the design for Tunduma Hospital whose construction is underway,” Mr Jafo said. Briefing the minister, Dodoma Regional Medical Officer Dr James Kiologwe, said construction had been delayed due to delays in the disbursement of funds and map design. “Previously, the district hospital map design was endorsed for Uhuru Hospital construction,” he explained. Dodoma Regional Commissioner (RC), Dr Binilith Mahenge, said authorities in Dodoma formed a joint committee with Regional Administration and Local Government (TAMISEMI), saying the committee was tasked to find a plot for the construction project which it acquired. “The committee was also tasked to make follow ups on funds for the construction project and hospital map design,” said the Dodoma RC. Dr Mahenge proposed that local experts be assigned to prepare the design and undertaking the construction project because they are conversant with the country’s environment.
