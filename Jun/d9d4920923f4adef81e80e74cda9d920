RESIDENTS of Tegeta Pwani on the outskirts of Dar es Salaam are up in arms against what they termed as invasion of an open space. In a fiery meeting convened by the residents and attended by local government officials, they accused some of the officials of working in cahoots with an investor who is planning to put up a hospital on a piece of land which they describe as a playing ground. They said that for years now plot 1390 in the area has been used as a playground, and were surprised when they were told that an investor has been allowed to put up a hospital on the piece of land. “This investor is claiming that he has been allocated the area by the government to put up a hospital. The residents of this area are not in need of a hospital, because we have plenty of those around us, what we need is a playground for our children and youths to use,” said an enraged resident, Rosemary Mwakitwange. She said that even if the area was earmarked for a hospital, then they expected it to be a government facility, not a private hospital from a private individual. The area Ward executive Officer, Ikunda Lyimo said that the initial plan for the area from the government which was drawn in 1989 indicates that the land was reserved for a health facility, and not an open space. She said that the investor, VidaMed had followed the procedure of acquiring the land from the Ministry of Land, because initial plans drawn by the government indicates that the area was earmarked for a health facility. Another resident, Salim Kanyika said that the government should intervene in this scenario and avert a possible situation which could breach the peace, saying that for years now youths in the area have been using the place for their sport activities.
