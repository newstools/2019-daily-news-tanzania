NATIONAL Environment Management Council (NEMC) has ordered owners of social halls, bars and religious institutions that are located in residential areas to control noise pollution. Addressing journalists, NEMC Director General Dr Samuel Gwamaka said the council has been receiving complaints from many people in different parts of the country regarding noise pollution in their residential areas. “We have been receiving many complaints from people on this problem, we would like to instruct owners of social halls, bars and religious institutions to control sounds and ensure that there is no noise pollution in their surrounding areas,” he noted. Dr Gwamaka said the 2004 Environmental Act and its regulations forbid any kind of noise in residential areas. He said the law directs people to conduct activities in authorised areas and ensure that they install sound proof in their buildings to control noises. He said NEMC has realised that the problem is increasing because the said buildings have been constructed in residential areas. “We have realised in our studies that the problem has been caused by poor town planning, this has caused the construction of worshiping houses, bars and social halls in residential areas,” he said. A resident of Kigamboni, Mr Mohammad Twaha commended NEMC for the move, saying the situation was getting worse every day in various parts of the country. “I support NEMC order, we have been living difficult lives due noise pollution in our streets,” he said.
