KAGAME Cup defending champions Azam FC yesterday unveiled Burundian Etienne Ndayiragije as new Head Coach. The tactician takes over a vacant post following the departure of Dutch trainer, Hans van der Pluijm, who alongside his assistant Juma Mwambusi were sacked by the club early this year. Abdul Mingange was holding the post temporarily and was assisted by Iddi Cheche. And, after weeks of speculations, Ndayiragije yesterday penned a twoyear deal to be in charge of the ‘ice cream makers’ for the 2019/2020 Mainland Premier League season, Kagame Cup and CAF Confederation Cup campaigns. Last week, Ndayiragije parted company with Dar es Salaam based side KMC, after guiding the team to finish fourth in their debut season at the Mainland Premier League. KMC also earned a ticket to compete in CAF Confederation Cup. Ndayiragije made his name at Mbao FC from Mwanza, before he joined the league debutants KMC and helped the club finish fourth of the top flight league. The team also reached into the ASFC semifinals where they lost 1-0 to his possible destined side Azam FC. The Ice cream makers are readying for the Kagame Cup to be held in Rwanda from July 7th where they will compete as defending. Speaking shortly after signing the deal, Ndayiragije said he left KMC because he enjoys facing new challenges, insisting that the move was not purely motivated by financial gains “I enjoyed my stay at KMC… they are really good people but sometimes in football, we prefer to face new challenges and this is what I’ve chosen,” he said. “I know the challenge ahead is huge but I’m confident and ready to hard together with the rest in the team. Azam is one of the best teams in the country and I know they need the best from me,: he said.
