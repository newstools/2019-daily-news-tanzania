Mr Ndugai made the remarks yesterday in Dodoma when introducing to members of parliament 59 students from St Anne Marie Academy for their excellent performance in 2018 standard seven examinations. Mr Rweikiza is among Tanzanians who for a very long time have invested heavily in the education sector by building schools that include St Anne Marie Academy, Sunshine of Kibaha, Brilliant Secondary School and Rweikiza Nursery and Primary school. The speaker said in standard seven national examinations, St Anne Marie Academy emerged number one in Dar es Salaam Region, number one in Ubungo District and number six at national level. Mr Ndugai also introduced to members of parliament 39 students from Sunshine who got division one and two in 2018 national form four examinations. St Anne Marie Head Teacher Gladius Ndyetabura said 59 of the students who sat the standard seven examinations in 2018 got an average of A, enabling the school to be number one in Dar es Salaam, number one in Ubungo District and number six at national level. Mr Ndyetabura said the school management offered different gifs for students who perform well in national examinations something he said had helped the schools to be on top in national examinations. He said they plan to take their students who perform wonders in examinations in countries like Dubai, United Kingdom and United States as a motivation for other students to perform better . “We have been sending our students who perform well to visit national parks like Serengeti, Mikumi, Ngorongoro for many years so our future plan is to take them abroad and it is possible we can do it,” he added.
