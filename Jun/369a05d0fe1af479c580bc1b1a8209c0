KNOWLEDGE gaps among women, socio-cultural issues, administrative and institutional barriers are challenges that women still face in accessing and owning land in Zanzibar. This was revealed here at the launch of a six month project dubbed ‘Promote Women Rights in Zanzibar through Advocacy and Empowerment (PWRZAE)’ in some parts of Zanzibar where many women still cannot own property, including land, because of challenges that can be solved. “The main goal of the project is to reduce the existing strong patriarchal system hindering women and young girl’s access to control over land and property rights in north region and central district,” Dr Mzuri Issa said. Ms Issa is the Director of Tanzania Media Women Association (TAMWA)- Zanzibar implementing the project supported by the ‘Foundation for Civil Society (FCS).’ The project is the continuation of similar projects done in the past, such as Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment (GEWE). According to a survey conducted in 2017/2018, only less than 25 percent of adult women own land in Zanzibar, necessitating concerted efforts to bring changes that will enable gender equality in land ownership. Ms Fatma Kwale, the Project Manager, said “We aim at achieving the objectives by ensuring that obstacles are removed. It is fortunate that land policy and religion allows women to own land, and even guidelines are provided to enable women own properties.” Women or target groups in North A, North B, and Central on Unguja Island will be reached and be empowered and educated about their rights in property ownership, along with legal procedures to follow in search of ownership. Local leaders and land officers are also involved in the project which runs between May and October 2019.
