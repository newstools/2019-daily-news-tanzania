DEPUTY Minister for Information, Tourism and Antiquities Choum Kombo Khamis has asked all members of the House to promote local tourism by visiting tourist sites accompanied by their voters. “You have a big role to play in supporting government’s initiatives to promote tourism. Our future tourism depends on continued marketing and improved services,” Ms Khamis said. Before the deputy minister’s statement, Mr Suleiman Sarahani Said (Chakechake) wanted to know what measures the ministry had been taking to promote local tourism in line with President Ali Mohamed Shein’s directives. The deputy minister said adults, students and children should be encouraged to visit historical and tourist sites in the country, which were often visited by foreigners. “Let us change our attitudes on tourism. It is not only for foreigners.” She said Zanzibar was rich in historical sites, including caves, buildings and forest species and beautiful beaches, but many people, including the youth thought tourism was for foreigners only.
