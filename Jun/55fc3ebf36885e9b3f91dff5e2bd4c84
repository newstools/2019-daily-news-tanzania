AUTHORITIES in Ngara District are investigating why a primary school teacher has been rejected by villagers of Buhororo Ward, accusing her of being a witch. According to Ngara District Executive Director (DED), Aidan Bahama, the teacher is from Buhororo Primary School. “We are closely investigating the incident. More details will be given after thorough investigation,” he stressed. Kibimba Councillor John Bigilimana said a village meeting was held on Thursday and was attended by more than 300 villagers, who unanimously voted that they had no confidence in the woman, asking her employer to transfer her to another station. “For her own safety we have recommended to the district executive director to transfer her to another station or assign her other duties,” he said without elaborating further.
