SPECIAL Olympics Tanzania (SOT), said they plan to upgrade playing grounds of some Primary Schools which will be used during the Play Unified, Learn Unified project expected to hit the ground soon. This was revealed yesterday by SOT National Director Charles Rays who insisted that apart from modernizing school grounds, they will also be responsible to buy sport gear for the targeted teams. “As you know, most schools have unfriendly playing fields which lack adequate attention that is why this project will among other things make sure that we renovate them where necessary,” he said. He also said they aim to impart coaching skills to some coaches who will be applying them to the intellectual disabled children in areas where they live. Recently, SOT team had a fruitful learning trip to Kenya where the similar project is successfully being implemented. “We had a chance to meet with Special Olympics leaders from Kenya and visited a single school which is embracing the initiative. From what we saw, it was difficult to notice intellectual disabled children from their normal colleagues as they played well together without any problems,” Rays said. He added: “This is exactly what we want to achieve in the country to escalate awareness to people that intellectual challenged persons can equally perform any task provided they have been given a good environment to do so.” Already SOT has identified five regions which are Dar es Salaam, Morogoro, Mtwara, Mwanza and Tanga as the areas to start with in implementing the project where five schools in each region will be selected to undertake the Play Unified, Learn Unified project. Apparently, Tanzania is a second country in Africa to be selected for the initiative after Kenya who are now in their second year of running the same project.
