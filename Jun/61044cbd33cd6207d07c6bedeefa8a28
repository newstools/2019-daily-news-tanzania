IN what can be described as a major financial boost, the government has received a total of 21.6bn/-in revenue collected from the Wildlife Management Area (WMA), since 2007 when the Wildlife Resources User Rights was handed over to the authority. The remark was made yesterday in Parliament by Deputy Minister for National Resources and Tourism, Constatine Kanyasu adding that the money was generated through different activities like photo and poaching tourisms. That was in his response to a question asked by the Longido Member of Parliament (MP-CCM), Steven Kiruswa who had sought to know what the government has got in terms of revenue since the WMAs were established in the country in 2003/2004. “What is the government plan to develop more WMAs in different parts of the country?” further asked the lawmaker, also questioning when WMA in Lake Natron shall be given users rights. In further response the deputy minister explained that in 2003 the government established WMA on pilot projects in 16 areas in the country, and thereafter evaluation on the same was done in 2007. He noted that it was realised that involvement of residents to allocate village land for wildlife management through WMA had positive results and a lot of importance to the locals. He said that thereafter the government continued to implement the wildlife policy throughout the nation, and has been encouraging residents in areas where there are wildlife to start WMAs in accordance with the law. “To date at least 38 WMAs have been established countrywide, 22 of them acquired users’ right for wildlife management, while the remaining are on different stages of rights’ allocations” noted the deputy minister.
