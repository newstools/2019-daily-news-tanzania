EFFICIENT logistic networks and systems have been stressed as critical factors for African ports to grow and adequately facilitate global trade. Speaking at the 3rd Africa Ports Expansion Conference on behalf of TPA Director Deusdedith Kakoko in Dar es Salaam recently, Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA), Marketing and Public Relations Director, Fransisca Muindi noted that the future of African ports lied in the power of the Africans themselves to shape them. “It is undeniable that the future prospects of African ports are promising and the need for these ports to grow requires workable logistic networks and systems. Gaining an insight into port expansion projects on the continent as well as inland connectivity projects for a seamless transport that we all serve is crucial,” said Ms Muindi. She pointed out that the majority of the African countries had embarked on comprehensive programmes of expanding ports and improving transport systems with a view to serving the expansive hinterland and ultimately reduce the cost of doing business. According to her, continental ports are the main gateways used by countries to access global trade and international trade. “It is encouraging to note that over the decade, some of the continent’s ports have undertaken significant investments to improve infrastructure and ICT with a view to increasing productivity, efficiency in resources utilisation in terms of deliverable services. “The reason why the government of Tanzania under the current leadership is keen and already undertaken some major infrastructural projects such as the Dar es Salaam Maritime Gateway Project and the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) project, is evidence that we are committed to transforming the country into an industrial and middle-income economy.” The TPA director noted that the goal was to enable Dar es Salaam Port, which is the country’s principal port, currently handling over 90 per cent of the seaborne traffic both for domestic and neighbouring countries to offer efficient seamless transport services and ultimately enable the port to lead the regional maritime trade and logistic services to excellence.
