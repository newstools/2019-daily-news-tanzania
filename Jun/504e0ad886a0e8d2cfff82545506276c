THE Minister for Health, Mr Hamad Rashid Mohamed, has said that the increasing number of expectant mothers is to blame for bed sharing in labor wards, and that family planning will be among solutions to overcome congestion. “Our hospital’s delivery rooms are overwhelmed by big numbers of mothers ready to give birth. This is also attributed to free health care, as many residents and some from outside Zanzibar come for the free services,” said Mohamed. Mohamed’s statement was in response to legislators, including Ms Hidaya Ali Makame (Special Seats), who expressed concern over sharing of beds in delivery rooms, mainly at Mnazi Mmoja Hospital in the Stone Town. The legislator said it was unacceptable for expectant mothers to share a bed when preparing to give birth, and that the ministry should find more space to accommodate pregnant mothers who visit hospitals. Increasing number of women, who visit hospitals instead of relying on Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs), is also attributed towards increased awareness among members of the society about using hospitals. The labor room is one of the most versatile rooms in a hospital, also called delivery, and recovery room.
