THE Bank of Tanzania (BoT) has said the utilisation of interoperability capability in mobile money services reached 146.5 million transactions worth 4.88tri/- in the period to April from July last year compared to 80.7 million transactions worth 3.30tri/- of the corresponding period 2017/18. According to the BoT Monetary Policy Statement 2019/20, this represents 81.6 percent increase in volume and 47.7 percent in value. The interoperability of mobile financial services has contributed to overall growth of total mobile money transactions by 15.4 percent in volume and 15.6 percent in value, compared to the corresponding period of 2017/18. The number of active registered accounts for mobile money stood at 22.4 million as at the end of April compared with 20.1 million and 20.6 million at the end of April and June last year, respectively. In February this year, BoT launched a project to develop an instant payment system Tanzania Instant Payment System (TIPS) which is expected to be operational by June 2020. TIPS is a single instant payment platform that will connect different payment systems providers in cost effective and secured manner. Through interoperability of digital financial service providers, the system is expected to facilitate financial inclusion. Since July last year all government payments are made through Treasury Single Account (TSA) and processed through Tanzania Automated Clearing House (TACH) and Tanzania Interbank Settlement System (TISS) which is for transactions above 10m/-. The East Africa Payment System (EAPS) also operated smoothly and transactions increased, suggesting increased trade activities between Tanzania and some other EAC countries. During the period, transactions between Tanzania and Kenya were 2,321 valued at 3.5 billion Kenyan shilling, an increase of 0.3 percent in volume and 4.3 percent in value. Transactions between Tanzania and Uganda were 281, valued at 22.6 billion Ugandan shilling, a growth of 95.9 percent in volume and 55.2 percent in value, when compared with corresponding period of 2017/18. The BoT said also that the Electronic Fund Transfers (EFT) through TACH continued to run smoothly, with growing number of transactions, following increased use of the system by the Government in making payments of salaries to civil servants. During the period July 2018 to April 2019, the volume of EFT transactions grew by 19.0 per cent, while the value increased by 36.4 per cent when compared to the corresponding period of 2017/18. The increased use of EFT by the government has improved efficiency, while minimizing costs associated with the use of cheque. The effect was also reflected in the decline in usage of Tanzanian shilling denominated cheque in TACH, both in terms of volume and value by 12.3 per cent and 19.6 per cent, respectively.
