MORE than 3,000 students from six East African Community Member States will be gathering in Arusha in August for the Regional sporting events. The competition will be held here in the auspices of the Federation of East African Secondary Schools Sports Association (FEASSSA). Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and South-Sudan will be represented in the East African Schools sporting competition to be staged in Arusha from August 15th to 25th and already education officials from five of the participating countries have jetted into Arusha to make initial arrangements and preparation for the event. According to Leonard Tadeo, the Director of Sports Development for the Department of Education Supervision in the President’s Office, Regional Administration and Local Government, Zanzibar will also be represented in the games as separate entity from the mainland. “The games will help groom upcoming sports talents in our countries and as far as Tanzania is concerned, we are sending the winning teams from the ongoing Inter-Secondary and Inter-Primary School competitions so as to guarantee better performance,” he said. On his part, Aaron Sokoni the Chairperson of the National Inter- Secondary (UMISSETA) and Inter-Primary (UMITASHUMTA), said regional winners in the ongoing secondary school games will be picked to compete in the forthcoming FEASSSA events next August. “I am taking this opportunity to encourage all schools to work hard so that they may be chosen to participate in the National finals to be held in Mtwara Region, because the first to fourth winners will be the ones to represent the country in East African games,” said Sokoni. The President of FEASSSA, Mugisha Justus said so far the arrangements are going as planned and that the regional secondary school games will roll out a total 13 types of sports including, soccer, handball, lawn tennis, table tennis, rugby, netball, volleyball, swimming, hockey and athletics.
