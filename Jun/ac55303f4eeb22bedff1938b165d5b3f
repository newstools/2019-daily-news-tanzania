DEFENDING champions Azam FC have been paired against KCCA of Uganda in group B of this year’s CECAFA Kagame Cup. Apart from KCCA, the two-time reigning champions Azam will be confident of progressing to the last eight after drawing home side Mukura FC and Bandari of Kenya in the tournament due next month in Rwanda. Another Mainland side, KMC have been paired against hosts Rayon Sports, the reigning Rwandan champions and one-time CECAFA Kagame Cup winners in group A. The arguably tough group also has DR Congo giants TP Mazembe and South Sudan’s Atlabara. Rwanda will be hosting the tournament, Africa’s oldest club competition, for the first time since 2014. Local giants APR, who are in Group C along with Green Buffaloes of Zambia, Ugandan outfit Proline and Heegan from Somalia, won three of the previous four editions held in Rwanda – in 2004, 2007 and 2010 – before finishing second in 2014. Gor Mahia, Kenya’s most successful club will go into the two-week competition as Group D favourites following their relatively easy draw against Motema Pembe of DR Congo, KMKM of Zanzibar and Djibouti’s AS Ports. Speaking during the drawing ceremony at Ferwafa headquarters on Friday, the CECAFA Secretary General, Nicholas Musonye, underscored that sixteen teams is a fitting number for a good tournament. “The tournament is going to be very competitive,” he said, noting that “the addition of guest teams from DR Congo and Zambia will be a good test to our players and clubs ahead of the new continental football season.” Group A and Group C matches will be played in Kigali, Group B in Huye District, while Umuganda Stadium, in Rubavu District, will host Group D games. Winners of the annual tournament will go home with $30,000 (Rwf27 million) in cash prize, beaten finalists pocket $20,000 (Rwf 18 million) while the second runners-up will receive $10,000, around Rwf 9 million.
