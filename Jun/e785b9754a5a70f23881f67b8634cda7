YOUNG Africans Congolese tactician, Mwinyi Zahera has expressed his gratitude to their rival Simba, for their effort in the recently ended CAF Champions League, which has enabled his team to be part of the tournament next season. The appreciation came two days after CAF confirmed that Tanzania will be represented with four teams in the inter-club tournaments. The 12 highest ranked national associations, according to CAF rankings will be allowed to engage two teams in CAF Champions League and two others in CAF Confederation Cup for the 2019/20 season. Simba, who are the Mainland champions and second placed Yanga will compete in the Champions League, while Azam FC, who won the Azam Sports Federation Cup (ASFC) and KMC, who finished fourth in the top flight league will be the country’s envoys in Confederation Cup. According to the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) Information Officer, Cliford Ndimbo, the decision to pick Yanga and KMC to join the country’s authorized representatives in CAF interclub tournaments was made by the TFF Executive Committee due to the amendment made by the committee on regulation of the Mainland Premier League. And, to show his appreciation and joy for the opportunity, Yanga coach Zahera posted on his instagram page: What an incredible atmosphere! Thanks you @simbasctanzania for making us be part of the championship.

The club Patron and Kinondoni Municipal Council, Lord Mayor, Benjamin Sitta was so pleased with the opportunity, saying they are looking forward to make major improvement in their team including the technical bench.
