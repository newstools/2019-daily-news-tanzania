KAGERA Sugar Head Coach Mecky Mexime said he had no doubt that his side will remain in the league next season despite their destiny being achieved after two playoff games. The Bukoba-based giants hammered Pamba FC 2-0 at Kaitaba Stadium over the weekend in the second leg of the play-off that assured them a stay in the top flight contest next season. In another match, Mwadui FC outplayed G eita G old 2-1 at Mwadui Complex in Shinyanga to also regain a ticket to continue featuring in the Mainland Premier League next season. Mwadui's top goal scorer Salum Aiyee netted twice for his team with his last minute strike on the day making the difference. At some point of the clash, the scoreboard was 1-1 which could have favoured the visiting team Geita G old if it remained the same at the end of the game since an away goal rule is also observed in playoff matches. However, Aiyee came to the rescue of his sinking ship which revealed how good he is as far as scoring goals is concerned mainly in decisive ties. With the defeats, both Pamba and G eita G old will have to work hard again in the First Division League (FDL) to stand another chance of being promoted into the senior league next season. The only two teams which have graduated into the 20-team top league are Polisi Tanzania and Namungo FC who respectively finished on top in their groups on their way to promotion.
