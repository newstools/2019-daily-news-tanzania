AT least 194 anti-corruption clubs comprising 3,441 members have been established in various schools to fight against corruption. Kagera Regional Head of the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB), John Joseph told reporters that the clubs were established in primary, secondary schools and colleges and about 2,300 new members were expected to be registered this year. “Establishing such anti-corruption clubs involving pupils and students is extremely important as they are moulded at tender age to be future leaders,” he said. Mr Joseph noted that many complaints received by his office were land-related, where people complained about the issuance of land permits and inheritance. According to him, other complaints were directed towards ward tribunals. “Investigation shows that some members of the land tribunals are either ignorant or greedy, thus violate by-laws,” he said. He explained that between July last year and March this year about 440 complaints were received with 100 files opened, while 50 complaints were finalised. He also said in mid-July this year his office would launch a public awareness campaign nicknamed “Bukoba Titukwenda Kyemenyo”, literary meaning: “In Bukoba we are against corruption” where residents would be educated about the evils of corruption.
