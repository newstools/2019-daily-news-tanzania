THE national amputee football team ‘Tembo Warriors’ began the ongoing East and Central Africa Amputee Football (CECAAF) championships positively after defeating Rwanda 3-0 at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam over the weekend. It was the opening match of this year’s CECAAF contest which has attracted five countries. The home team’s hitman Frank Ngairo scored a brace on the day while Majani Khalfan contributed one goal to register the massive win out of the tricky fixture. Here, it was difficult for the visitors to make a remarkable come back despite making a couple of substitutions to suit the rhythm of the hot clash. In the second match on the day, Zanzibar smashed Uganda 1-0 which was also a good start for the Isles side. In his remarks, CECAAF General Secretary Moses Mabula disclosed that the competition is being held for the first time insisting that so far, reception from the public has been overwhelming. “We hope that as we continue to popularise this sport, more countries from EAC will be able deploy their teams,” Mabula said. He then called more Tanzanians to storm the 60,000 capacity venue to witness the ongoing competitive games. Teams which are competing are Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Zanzibar and hosts Tanzania.
