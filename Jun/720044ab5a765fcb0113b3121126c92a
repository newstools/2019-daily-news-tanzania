WEIGHT and Measures Agency (WMA) has started verification of cotton weighing machines ahead of the crop farming season in a bid to enable farmers benefit more from the cash crop. Speaking during an inspection tour conducted at the weekend in Lake Zone cotton-producing regions, the WMA Communications and Public Relations Manager, Irene John said the authority was determined to ensuring that the buyers use genuine weighing machines. She said the agency was going through all Lake Zone regions to check if the machines have not been tempered with by few unscrupulous traders who are bent to reap more at the expense of farmers. “As we are inching closer to the cotton growing season, we want to make sure that the weighing machines are inspected and those which are invalid are not allowed to be used. We will also go for machines used for coffee, tobacco and other cash crops,” she noted. Ms Irene noted that since they started inspection, they have yet to come across any machine which has been tempered with save for minor faults. She thanked the government for its recent move of empowering the agency by making amendments to some of the laws which previously impeded the body to effectively carry out its duties. Regions where the agency has already conducted inspection include Tabora, Shinyanga, Simiyu, Mwanza, Geita and Katavi.
