EDUCATION stakeholders have called for a review of corporal punishment administered on students deemed rogue in schools. Converging here recently, the stakeholders affiliated to the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania (ELCT) observed that it is within the teachers’ discretion to determine the kind of punishment a student should get contrary to the directives of the Ministry of Education. The players hinted that any punishment being meted to a student should be considerate and in line with the directives and guidelines stipulated by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology. “Some of the punishments that our children get while in schools are barbaric in nature and lower their self-esteems as far as academic lives are concerned,” pointed out ELCT Education Director, Ms Christowaja G erson Mtinda. She further said that as such corporal punishments are tantamount to G ender Based Violence (G BV) and urged teachers to shun them. “It is sad to note that these punishments start from the household level and it is even made worse in schools,” Mtinda said. Equally, she called upon the public and stakeholders to protect children from pedophiles. On his part, ELCT’s G BV Project Coordinator Mr Pendaeli Kuyan Lukumay said that the Church was now embracing the Time Travel Method as it heals past social injustices and address related social ills. The initiative’s goal is to promote learning, social cohesion and contribute to community building, according to Mr Lukumay. “The aim is to create community groups and support education in schools, as platforms for learning, dialogue and reflection, using local heritage,” he added. The Project Coordinator further said that plans were underway for the ELCT to cooperate with the Arusha Declaration Museum to spearhead the drive. Other countries that have embraced the system include Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Lithuania, Latvia and Nicaragua.
