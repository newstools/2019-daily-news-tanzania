Only two days after President John Magufuli received from India’s Bharti Airtel a total of 5.27bn/-, the Head of State has appointed Mr Omari Nundu Chairman of the board of directors of Airtel Tanzania with effect from Wednesday. The appointment is an implementation of the agreement between Bharti Airtel and the government after negotiations over the ownership and running of the mobile phone company. According to the agreement, the board chair of Airtel Tanzania is supposed to be appointed by the government. Similarly, the appointment of Airtel Tanzania Chief Technical Officer (CTO) is required to be made by the State,  to which end Dr Prosper Mafole  has been slotted. Under the new arrangement, the government is entitled to appoint three board members out of seven to the Airtel Tanzania board of directors. The two other members appointed to represent the government in the board are Mr John Sausi and Mr Lekinyi Mollel. Meanwhile, President Magufuli has appointed Mr Mohammed Mtonga, the new chairman of the board of directors of Tanzania TTCL Corporation to fill the vacancy created in the wake of Nundu’s appointment as Airtel Tanzania board chairman. The positive development in Airtel Tanzania resulted  from intensive negotiations between Bharti Airtel International and the government over the ownership of the mobile phone firm.
