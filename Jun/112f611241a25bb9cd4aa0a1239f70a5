THE government has secured investors who have agreed to set up factories to process pigeon peas in the country. Deputy Minister for Industry and Trade, Engineer Stellah Manyanya, told the National Assembly yesterday that the government has come up with short and long term strategies to secure markets for farmers and traders across the country who have been holding hundreds of tonnes of the legume for lack of market. She said the long term plan is to encourage investors, both local and foreign, to set up factories that will help add value to the product, while the short term strategy, she said, is to secure immediate markets for the pigeon pea and other related farming produce. She said for the long term strategy, the Mahashree Agro Processing Ltd from India is constructing a factory in Morogoro region, and that by next month the factory will start operations, with the capability of processing 700,000 tonnes of pigeon pea annually. She said another factory, Quality Pulse Exporters Limited based in Dar es Salaam– SEZ (Agro Processing Pulse), whose investors are from Kenya and India is currently operating. The deputy minister said another factory, Samson Agro Export Limited – SEZ Industrial Park (Agro Processing Pulse), whose investors are from India is also operating. On short term strategy, Manyanya said the government has secured markets for pigeon pea in Malawi, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Zambia. She said Malawi has shown interest to buy 7,000 tonnes of pigeon peas, and efforts are on going to supply the market with the product. She was responding to a question by Nachingwea legislator, Hassan Masala (CCM), who said for the past few years, pigeon pea farmers and traders have been struggling to get reliable markets to sell their products, and the MP wanted to know the government’s strategy to help the farmers, who are left to stare at their stock piles.
