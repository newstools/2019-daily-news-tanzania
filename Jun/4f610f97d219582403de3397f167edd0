PREPARATIONS are on a top gear as Tanzania golf Union (TGU), as Tanzania Open Golf Championship readies to stage the forthcoming national level tournament. The annual country’s most prestigious golf competition is scheduled to tee off at Morogoro Gymkhana Club course in Morogoro from August 12 to 18 August this year. According to the TGU Competition Secretary, Enock Magile, top golfers from in and outside the country are expected to play in the event, whose preparation is going on steadily. For the first time, Tanzania Open is being fully organized by the union according the amendments introduced last year by new TGU management under Chris Martin presidency. The union has made major reforms in organizing the national level competitions most notably the selection of top events that will be solely the supervision of the union, the annual Tanzania Open. Magile said that TGU is happy to secure good sponsorship from Oryx Tanzania agree who will bankroll the tournament. The 69th edition of the tournament which brings together top amateur and professional golfers from Africa was last held at the par-73 Kili Golf course of Arusha. Magile said: “We are grateful that Oryx has agreed to support our event; this is one of the country’s biggest competitions.” He said that TGU works tirelessly to insure the competition meets the standards and brings new look that would differentiate it with tournaments organized at the club level. Magile added the have decided to give more days to the tournament because Morogoro Gymkhana has only nine holes, hence can not accommodate a big number of players. The competition secretary said the 72- hole championship is open for both men and ladies players. The last year’s event title was co-won by the national team Captain Victor Joseph and Kenyan Edwin Mudanyi. The two tied on aggregate 296 gross strokes after the end of the four rounds of 72 holes. It was decided to give them a playoff, but still no one emerged the winner.
