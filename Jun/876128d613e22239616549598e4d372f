TANZANIA Revenue Authority (TRA), at the Sirari border has uncovered an earthshaking conspiracy whereby untrustworthy traders operating here have been importing huge chemical spirits (ethanol) by using fake documents as well as providing false tax statements during clearance declarations aimed at evading tax. Following the development, TRA authorities here have directed its inspectors on the ground to put under revenue surveillance all traders owning large chemical storerooms a few kilometers from the Tanzanian-Kenyan border. The Assistant Regional TRA Manager, Mr Martin Kawonga, told reporters in Sirari on Wednesday that following thorough inspection by a special anti-smuggling unit in the stores, it was revealed that one trader had imported four million liters of the chemicals while during certification only 20,000 liters were registered with tax clearance. ‘’During inspection our team discovered that the trader operating a company identified as KARANTINI had imported a total of 4 million liters according to available documents since 2017, but during tax clearance exercise this year, the businessman had only registered 20,000 liters, which proves a point that the remainder was unaccounted for,’’ he explained. He further explained that despite various directions issued to traders to refrain from the vice, he had failed to comply with various provisions of tax law requirements. These have attracted penalties for tax recovery, including recently putting the suspected storeroom under revenue surveillance for an unspecified duration pending other legal actions.
