MOTORSPORTS fans have to wait till August this year to see again the dare-devil driving at closed circuit in Kigamboni, Dar es Salaam following the postponement of Mzizima Rally this weekend. The event which was earlier scheduled to rev off on Sunday, June 15 and 16, with over twenty crews expected, has been pushed to August on the date to be made public after confirmation from the Automobile Association of Tanzania (AAT), according to the organizers, Mzizima Motor Sports Club. The club’s Chairperson Monica Lyimo said they are forced to postpone the two-day rally due to unforeseen circumstances. “It will be staged at the same Kigamboni area in August, but the particular dates will be made public after being approved by AAT,” she said. She said all drivers, crews as well as officials have been informed and are awaiting the new dates. According to Lyimo, the expectations are high and as of until this week there were over 20 entries and she hoped the number to increase owing to the fact that the African rally championships are around the corner. She said the choice of Kigamboni areas meant to bring the rallying thrills too closer to the Dar es Salaam spectators. The entries in her list include local and foreign drivers from Kenya and Zambia. “So it won't just be a local event”. On behalf of the club, Lyimo apologized for inconveniences caused. “ It is in the best interest of the fans as well as the participants that these changes were made. We remain on track to bring you fun filled memorable rally challenge in August,” she said.
