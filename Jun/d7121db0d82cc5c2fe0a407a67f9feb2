FOR the first time in history the National Electoral Commission (NEC) has permitted 28 civil society organisations to provide voter education to update the voters’ register. NEC has also prepared guidelines for the provision of education countrywide in which 24 organisations are from Mainland Tanzania and four in Zanzibar. Speaking at a meeting with representatives from civil society organisations (CSOs) in Dar es Salaam yesterday, NEC Chairman Judge Semistocles Kaijage said NEC would monitor closely the provision of education. “NEC is also prepared to provide voter education in various ways, including meeting voters face-to-face, participating in various exhibitions and using a special vehicle that will be moving around the streets for the purpose,” he noted. Judge Kaijage further said there could be confusion about civic education. “It has to be understood that NEC is responsible for providing voter education only, but civic education is the obligation of political parties in accordance with the electoral law,” he said. The commissioner noted that in previous years NEC had been issuing permits during the general election only in which 66 CSOs were given permits in 2010 and 447 in 2015. NEC will commence the first phase to update the voters’ register in July 2019 before the general election next year. This year’s update involves only new voters, who have attained the age of 18 and above and those, who will be 18 years old during the next general election and those who want to update their information due to some reasons. T anzania is expected to hold local government elections this year under the supervision of the President’s Office Regional Administration and Local Government on behalf of NEC. Next year the country will hold the general election.
