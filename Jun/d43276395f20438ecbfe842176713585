The African Union Peace and Security Council has decided to suspend Sudan from all activities of the continental body, until the country’s ongoing political crisis is resolved. According to africannews.com, in a statement issued after a crisis meeting on Thursday, AU demanded the “establishment of a Civilian-led Transitional Authority, saying it was the only way to allow the Sudan to exit from the current crisis.” This Peace and Security Council reached the conclusion following the ongoing violence in Sudan as opposition groups demand the transition government which will lead to free and fair election.
