In an effort to reduce carbon emissions in the country, the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (Unido) will commence the distribution of ethanol stoves as a clean alternative fuel in August. The stoves will be distributed in Dar es Salaam in the first phase in which 110,000 stoves will be distributed to 500,000 households in five years. Unido National Project Coordinator Victor Akim told ‘Sunday News’ in an interview before a large scale rollout strategy for a stoves pilot study conducted in Zanzibar with positive results. “We expect to commence distribution in August this year in selected areas of Dar es Salaam. We hope that the project will take off and spread nationwide resulting in improved health for women and children,” he noted. Mr Akim further said that they were promoting the local private sector to develop an ethanol supply chain to ensure enough fuel for these stoves once they had been distributed. He said the stoves were expected to cost between 32,000/- and 80,000/- each and when purchasing subsidised stoves, customers would be required to buy 10 litres of bioethanol to jumpstart fuel demand. The bioethanol will be available to customers through the development of a distribution network. It is expected that the adoption of this clean fuel will allow families to reduce expenses on cooking fuels by 70 per cent from 80,000/- to 24,000/- every month.
