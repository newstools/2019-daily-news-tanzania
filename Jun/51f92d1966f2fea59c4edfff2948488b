THE Benjamin Mkapa Hospital (BMH) will today launch its urology unit that deals with all aspects of general urology, including operations for treating urinary incontinence in women and prostrate surgery of all types for men. Head of the Urology Unit at BMH, Dr Remigius Rugakingira, said here yesterday that the urology unit will include state-of-the-art equipment for obtaining diagnostic prostrate biopsies, saying operations are carried out by using laparoscopic method. “I appeal to residents of Dodoma and neighbouring regions with complications in the urinary tract system to make use of the service. BMH has installed modern equipment to conduct medical tests in the urinary tract system,” the urologist said. Dr Rugakingira explained that urology was a medical treatment that focuses on surgical and medical diseases of the male and female urinary tract system as well as male reproductive organs and that organs under the domain of urology include kidneys, adrenal glands, urinary bladder, urethra and male reproductive organs. He explained further that urologists at BMH will team up with their counterparts of Viena-based Open Medical Institute (OMI) to offer the medical treatment in aspects of urology beginning the week of opening. Dr Rugakingira pointed out that the urologists from OMI which is under the American Australian Foundation will also offer capacity building training to their counterparts of the Benjamin Mkapa Hospital. “The goal of capacity building training is to enable us to run the new urology unit at BMH efficiently. The partnership with OMI urologists provides us with a platform where we can borrow a leaf of experience from the urologists,” he said.
