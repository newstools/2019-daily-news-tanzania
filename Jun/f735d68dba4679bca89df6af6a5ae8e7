MEMBERS of Zanzibar House of Representatives have applauded President Ali Mohamed Shein for his personal efforts in improving health care in the country at a time when demand for better health services has grown. “We now have enough essential medicines and equipment in hospitals. People are happy with services in all our facilities. The President must be praised for his efforts,” Ms Zulfa Mmka Omar (Special Seats) said when debating the Ministry of Health 2019/2020 budget. Mr Suleimna Sarahani Said (Chakechke) said there are many visible and admirable achievements in the health sector attained under President Shein’s regime because of commitment to see that there is no problem in accessing health care. “We had many challenges in hospitals, including shortage of essential medicines, equipment, and poor working environment. At least it is now better,” Mr Sarahani said as he also praised Dr Shein for the improvement, including maintaining free services for pregnant mothers. However, both backbenchers were joined by their colleague, Ms Hidaya Ali Makame (Special Seats) to complain against use of rude language by some hospital staff, and congestion in the maternity ward at the Mnazi Mmoja Hospital. Ms Makame said “Unethical staff in facilities must be removed. Treatment starts with reception provided to patients. People who visit hospitals, mainly the sick and pregnant mothers, are not met with good reception. This should stop!”
