THREE suspects have been detained for sabotaging the Rural Energy Agency (REA) project as police investigations continue. Kagera Regional Police Commander (RPC) Revocatus Malimi named the suspects as Respicius Katunzi (30) and Japhet Adolf (40), both residents of Kemondo village in Bukoba Rural District and Johannes Francis (30) a businessman in Bukoba Municipal Council. He explained that on Sunday at around 9.30 pm the police, acting on a tip from a Good Samaritan, arrested the suspects after laying a trap. “The three suspects, with other people who managed to escape, entered REA camp at Kemondo trading centre where they stole 40 kilogrammes of neutral skin electricity wires whose value is yet to be established, the property of REA,” he said. The RPC noted that investigations were continuing to establish the market where the suspects were selling the wires, adding that the suspects will be arraigned upon completion of investigations. Mr Malimi further elaborated that in another incident, three suspects are under police custody over allegations of stealing nine heads of cattle. He named them as Juvenal Martin (39), Evarist Luhina (47) and Jovinus Mwijage (20), all residents of Kasharu village in Bukoba Rural District. He said on May 29, this year unknown thieves stole 17 heads of cattle from Anatolia John (9 heads of cattle) and Muhsin Kashamba (8 heads of cattle), both residents of Katoro village in Bukoba Rural. “Police managed to arrest the three suspects in possession of nine heads of cattle. Investigations continue to establish the market and also their other accomplices. They will be taken to court when investigations are completed,” he said.
