DELEGATION from Zimbabwe is expected to visit the country for five days to assess the quality of maize, among other things. The delegation will be visiting the country a few days after President John Magufuli made a commitment to sell 700,000 tonnes of maize during his trip to Zimbabwe. Minister for Agriculture, Mr Japhet Hasunga (pictured), said the delegation will arrive in the country tomorrow and expected to depart on June 7, 2019. “The purpose of their visit is to assure themselves on several things, including the quality of maize,” he told directors of institutions and departments in the ministry. Mr Hasunga said Zimbabwe has also considered procuring other crops such as cashew nuts, legumes, vegetables and fruits. Tanzania is to export 700,000 tonnes of maize to Zimbabwe, where according to the UN, 15 million people face food insecurity following the El-Nino induced drought that wreaked havoc on Zimbabwe’s agricultural sector and caused grain shortages. Dr Magufuli told his host that Tanzania had a total of 3.3 million tonnes of surplus food after harvesting 16.8 million tonnes, while the country’s needs do not exceed 13.5 million tonnes. In April, Zimbabwe appealed for $613 million in aid from local and foreign donors to cover food imports and help with a humanitarian crisis after severe drought and a cyclone battered the east of the country. An appeal document given to reporters by the information ministry showed the government is seeking about $300 million in aid for food while the rest would fund emergency shelters, logistics and telecommunications, among other needs.
