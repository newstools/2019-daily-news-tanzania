THE Minister for Trade and Industries, Mr Innocent Bashungwa has cautioned authorities mandated to oversee business regulations to be facilitators rather than impediments. He sounded the caution here yesterday during his first meeting with heads of institutions under his ministry since his appointment last week, whose objectives included strategizing and creating a common network for a conducive business environment. Mr Bashungwa said there was a need for the institutions to work as a team in serving business operators well and strive to improve the business environment, adding that the goal could be achieved only if they worked as a team. He said they would work closely with the ministry of agriculture, to spearhead the economic drive. “We will work closely with the ministry of agriculture by deepening coordination so that it can be easy to come up with a business and marketing plan for each crop,” he said, adding: “There are a number of opportunities within the African blocs; we will have to come up with marketing plans that will make our business communities get returns on investment on the membership fees the country is paying in the blocs.” He said they want at the end of the day to have in place an inclusive economy for the public improved social and economic welfare. The Minister directed the workers and institutions under his ministry to observe customer care approach in handling their clients. He said that can only be attained if there is a change in the mindset in term of how they approach issues of their customers, by being, for most part, customer care oriented. He went further by tasking them to fast track legal and policy documents during the 2019/20 financial year to address the challenges facing the industry. The minister said, furthermore, that a conducive business environment would be created, to enable investors forge business partnerships, by doing which revenue generation and job opportunity creation would be enhanced.
