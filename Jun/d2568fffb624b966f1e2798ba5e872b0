THE Deputy Minister for Resources and Tourism, Constantine Kanyasu has hailed efforts of financial institutions in the country for seeing the essence of providing loans to local entrepreneurs to enable them invest in the sector and raise their incomes. Praising them for the effort yesterday in Arusha, the Deputy Minister singled out NMB bank in particular among others while visiting the bank’s pavilion in Arusha at the Tourism stakeholder’s event organised by Karibu Kili Fair Company which the bank sponsored. He said that the presence of the bank to sponsor the company in organizing the event would enlighten and further make them network and share ideas on how to address challenges in the sector. “The government is supporting NMB’s efforts and you know the way we have been working together as a team, especially with NMB bank to bring development to the public. I urge you to also put a lot of focus on the tourism sector in the Southern zone regions, where some opportunities have not been tapped,” he added. Mr Kanyasu further said that the government was interested in opening the zone to the extent of bringing Administrative Secretaries in their regions to also attend the biggest event in East Africa so that they can acquire knowledge that will be necessary for the implementation of the Regrow project in the area which is being funded by the World Bank. On his part, Songwe Region Administrative Secretary, David Kafulila pointed out that President John Pombe Magufuli had directed the Southern Zone regions to cooperate for the development of the areas and hence as government officials, they believe the bank will ensure it partners with the entrepreneurs to get loans’ access.
