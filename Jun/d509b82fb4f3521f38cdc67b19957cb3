TANZANIA Portland Cement (TPC PLC) trading as Twiga Cement on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) has registered operating profit of 80.06bn/- last year which is 28 per cent up from 62.67bn/- posted on 2017 on account of efficient cost management. The company’s Managing Director, Alfonso Velez told shareholders during the 27th Annual General Meeting held in Dar es Salaam over the weekend that the growth was mainly due to higher total revenue (28 per cent) and clinker production, despite higher selling and administrative expenses (9 per cent) and strong reduction of fixed non-operating assets sales that were performed in 2017. “There is positive trend in terms of variable cost reduction as a result of more efficient raw materials and energy cost management that becomes must to face the current market environment,” he said. During the year under review, the cement company jumped to 56.86bn/- up from 35.59bn/- He noted that, the cash flow position has also improved and company’s balance sheet remained robust and healthy mainly due to higher current assets, particularly higher cash and equivalents, making possible to deliver good dividends to shareholders. “Year 2018 was also critical to consolidate the processes and the organization at country level, but also a good opportunity for TPC PLC to lead the new East African Cluster with its best practices. All these efforts together with the operational improvements are making possible to offset the stiff competition and to face the coming challenges with a stronger financial position,” he added. The MD further noted that the Operating Profit increased by 28 per cent compared with the previous year, with drivers being sales volume increase, higher clinker production and price stability, which provided the ground to sustain and secure the dividends to shareholders at a predictable high level. “TPC PLC increased sales volume above 9 per cent compared to year 2017, our strong and loyal customer network made it possible, extending our commercial efforts to all the Tanzanian territory and neighbouring countries and ensuring the brand recognition as a premium for all our customers,” he said. Velez admitted that, large overcapacities will remain a challenge for the industry, but said he was confident in his teams, products and services to keep supporting customers finding the best solutions in such a competitive market place and to ensure continuous value creation for our stakeholders.
