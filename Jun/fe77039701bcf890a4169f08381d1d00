FORMER Taifa Stars and Young Africans Head Coach, Boniface Mkwasa said he is eager to return back to his coaching duties, as he is now fit after a full recovery. Mkwasa has been silent for an extended period of time, after undergoing what he said a successful heart related surgery in India, but insisted that he is now ready to get back on the field. “It’s true that I have been quite for a long time, because I was adhering to prescription advised by doctors, but now I am fit and set to take up coaching roles should any club be interested with my experience in the game,” Mkwasa said through a radio interview. He added that at the moment, he is planning to go back to India for checkup as recommended by his doctor, but he reiterated that he is fine and people should not worry about his condition. “As you know, when artificial organs have been put in your body, definitely, you cannot be as hundred percent as you were before that is why frequent checkups are vital hence I have to go not because I am sick but it is in response to the doctors’ advice,” he said. He continued: “I love football coaching a lot. I want to continue with my coaching philosophy, which is unique in the country. In view of this, when a coaching chance knocks, I will take it.” He also disclosed that despite being on medication, he has been doing body exercises as demanded by his doctors even though he said he has gained weight since the performed exercises were too easy. Mkwasa was named Taifa Stars coach, by the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF), in July 2015, taking over coaching responsibilities from then Head Coach Mart Nooij. However, his (Mkwasa), contract at the helm of Stars was prematurely terminated early in 2017, as the TFF picked Salum Mayanga to take charge of the team for the remaining period. Mkwasa, who has CAF class ‘A’ coaching licence, was later announced general secretary of Yanga, filling a position, which was vacant for a long time.
