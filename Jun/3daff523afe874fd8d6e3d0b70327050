THE overall balance of payments deficit widened to 1,089.2 million US dollars in the period ending April from July last year compared to a surplus of 299.2 million US dollars in the corresponding period of 2017/18, largely on account of widening of current account deficit. According to the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) Monetary Policy Statement, the current account deficit widened to 2,132.6 million US dollars from 1,709.5 million US dollars in July 2017 to April last year mainly driven by the increase in value of goods imports, particularly building and construction, machinery and fertilizers as export values remained broadly unchanged. During the period July 2018 to April 2019, the value of exports of goods and services amounted to 7,210.6 million US dollars compared with 7,291.9 million US dollars in the corresponding period of 2017/18. Exports value of non-traditional goods increased to 2,904.5 million US dollars from 2,573.5 million US dollars in July 2017 to April 2018 period, mainly due to improved export performance of gold and manufactured goods. Export value of gold the leading non-traditional export increased by 18.2 per cent to 1,405.1 million US dollars on account of volume. Similarly, manufactured goods exports rose by 11.2 per cent to 750.1 million US dollars mainly attributed to increase in exports value of glassware, ceramic, aluminum, soap, iron and steel. On the other hand, traditional goods exports declined by more than 50 per cent from the amount recorded in July 2017 to April 2018 period, on account of low performance of cashew nuts, cloves and tea exports. The decline in cashew nuts exports is associated with delays in exporting the crop, while for tea it was due to low prices in the global market. Meanwhile, value of cloves exports declined due to shrinkage in volume due to cyclical nature of the crop. The value of imported goods and services amounted to 9,024.9 million US dollars during the period July 2018 to April 2019, a 6.6 per cent increase from the levels recorded in the similar period of 2017/18. Significant increase was noted in capital goods imports, which is associated with the ongoing infrastructural projects in the country including construction of standard gauge railway, roads and bridges, airports and ports. Importation of fertilizers also increased during the period largely following bulk procurement of fertilizer by the government. Conversely, importation of food and foodstuff declined substantially due to satisfactory food availability across the country following good harvest during 2017/18 crop-season. The current account balance is projected to record deficit equivalent to 4.4 per cent of GDP in 2018/19, higher than 3.5 per cent in 2017/18, owing to expected increase in capital and intermediate goods imports. The projected increase in capital goods imports is consistent with the ongoing implementation of infrastructure projects, while that of intermediate goods is largely on account of expected increase in prices of oil in the world market and volume to be imported to match with domestic demand as the economy continue to grow.
