COULD this be a miserable end season for Coach Mecky Maxime? This is a 100 per cent question soccer fans are asking themselves ahead of the much-awaited match pitting Kagera Sugar against visiting Pamba FC from Mwanza. The two teams meet again in a play-off to be held at the Kaitaba Stadium today afternoon. In the first match played on Monday both teams were tied 0-0. Maxime took charges of the Kagera Sugar side during 2015/2016 season and enjoyed a reasonably respect stay enabling the team to end on third position during 2016/17 season behind Young Africans and Simba. However, the tide had changed for the worse this season with relegation-haunted Kagera Sugar being forced to a play-off with Pamba. A winner in today’s match will automatically win promotion to the premier league. Rumours are ripe that Maxime could possibly be signed by Yanga for the next season, but he has so far not confirmed the reports. Kagera Sugar defender Juma Nyoso, on the other hand, promised that the match will be a ‘do or die” affair. “We promise our fans that it will be a tough match and we expect to win,” he said. Kagera regional authorities have announced reduced entrance fee which will be 500/- for green stand and 1,000/- for VIP. The decision was taken to motivate many fans to enter the stadium and support the team. Kagera Regional Commissioner, Marco Gaguti welcomed the team at his office on Tuesday where he presented the players 1m/- as motivation, also appealing to Kagera residents to turn up in big numbers to support the team. “We are looking forward with enthusiasm a good game and wish the Kagera side a win,” he said amid applause. Kagera Regional Administrative Secretary (RAS), Prof Faustin Kamuzora, on his side, pledged to support the team whole-heartedly during the three days before the today’s match.
