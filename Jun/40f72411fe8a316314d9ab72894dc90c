TAIFA Stars captain Mbwana Samatta is targeting victory against Kenya in their Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) finals second Group C game tomorrow to get their campaign back on track. Stars fell to a 2-0 loss to Senegal in their opening game in the tournament, with goals from Keita Balde and Krepin Diatta. Emmanuel Amunike’s men will have to avoid defeat against the Harambee Stars to avoid early elimination from the competition and their skipper, Samatta has called for solid preparation to overcome their East African neighbours. “On that game, I think we really need to prepare ourselves for it because I don’t think Kenya are much better than us,” he said. “They are not like Senegal or Algeria so maybe it can be the game we can do something. But, still they are tough opponent, it is not going to be an easy game. “But we have to prepare well to earn points against them. And then see what we can do in our last game.” Tanzania face Algeria in their last group game in the Afcon tournament at the 30 June Stadium on July 1. Taifa Stars are making their second ever appearance in the competition and hope to reach the knockout stage for the first time in their history.
