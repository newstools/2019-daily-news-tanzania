THE Chinese Embassy in Tanzania has donated 330 sewing machines and 380 aiding equipment for people with various forms of disabilities worth 121.3m/- to help them in their various economic undertakings. Speaking during an event to hand over the donations here on Wednesday, Chinese Ambassador to the country, Ms Wang Ke, said the main aim of the donations, chanelled through Rafiki Programme, was to help women fight poverty. “Last year, we donated 350 sewing machines in four regions. This year, we are donating 330 sewing machines to women groups across six regions,” said the envoy, calling upon Chinese businesspeople who attended the event to spend part of the earnings to help the needy, particularly women, children and people with disabilities. She said the decision to come up with the programme was informed by an African saying that goes: “If you educate a woman, you educate the society while if you educate a man, you educate an individual”. Present at the event was Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office (Policy, Parliamentary Affairs, Labour, Employment, Youth and the Disabled), Ms Jenista Mhagama and her deputy, Ms Stella Ikupa and Ms Mhagama’s counterpart in the same ministry (Investment), Ms Angela Kairuki. According to Ms Mhagama, Tanzania has a total of 2,500,000 people with various forms of disabilities who must be empowered to enable them realise their real potentials. One of the six regions to benefit from the donation is Tabora, whose donation went through Chief Promotions managing director, Mr Amon Mkoga. “Through this, widowed women in Tabora will be able to get working tools that will help them to find money to pay school fees and health insurance for their children, among other commitments,” said Mr Mkoga.
