THE Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Kangi Lugola, has declared a war against police officers who  harass boda boda operators in various parts of the  country by parking their motorbikes at police stations on the grounds that they have  committed traffic offences. He said they should be given a seven day timeframe within which to pay fines as provided for by the law instead of confiscating their motorcycles for longer periods, thereby blocking them from conducting economic activities. The minister cited three categories of motorcycles that are supposed to be kept at police stations – the ones suspected to have been used in conducting criminal activities, lost properties that had been recovered and the ones that had been involved in accidents. “Any time from now, I will start making impromptu visits to various police stations countrywide to gather information on motorcycles that are parked there,’’ he said when responding to a  supplementary question by Ndanda constituency legislator Cecil Mwambe (CHADEMA) who expressed dismay over harassment by police officers, some of whom he claimed whipped suspected offenders. Mr Lugola said, however, that his ministry had not received any complaints centred on boda boda operators being whipped. During her main question, Special Seats MP Hawa Mwaifunga (CCM), wanted to know what the government was doing to curb road accidents which she said were destroying the country’s human resource by killing many people. In his response, Deputy Home Affairs Minister , Hamad Masauni said the government was doing so through a strategy coordinated by the National Road Safety Council, under which  accidents had been reduced by 43 per cent. “Under the fourth phase currently underway, we expect to reduce accidents by 35per cent,’’ said Mr Masauni.
