MAINLAND champions Simba have captured the signature of goalkeeper, Beno Kakolanya, whose relationship with his former club— Young Africans ended in cold. Kakolanya, one of the gifted goalkeepers in the country has signed a two year deal to feature for Simba in next season’s Mainland Premier League and CAF Confederation Cup. The Msimbazi Street leadership announced yesterday that the goalkeeper will serve the club next season. In January this year, Kakolanya officially wrote to Yanga, demanding termination of his contract, months after his relations with Head Coach, Mwinyi Zahera deteriorated. Then, Yanga came openly to give the way forward about then team’s first choice goalkeeper Kakolanya, who had been out of action since late last year. Kakolanya has never been included in Yanga squad ever since he returned home from international duty with the senior football team, Taifa Stars against Lesotho in November last year. The sour relationship between the two parties emerged on the day when the Jangwani Street team was preparing to go to Shinyanga to play their first Mainland Premier League match outside Dar es Salaam against Mwadui FC, when it was reported that the goalie refused to travel with the team. Since then, a lot has been said concerning Kakolanya. However, Yanga leadership insisted that the club has already paid Kakolanya all his dues.
