TWENTY Five people were injured, three of them seriously after a Tanzania Railway Corporation (TRC) passenger train from Kigoma to Dar es Salaam was hit by a lorry at Hazina Rail Crossway in Dodoma City yesterday. Three of the injured passengers were admitted to Dodoma Regional Hospital after sustaining serious injuries, while the rest were treated and discharged. Dodoma Regional Police Commander (RPC) Gilles Muroto said the accident occurred after a lorry (T 860 APW) driven by Mr Hamis Salamu (49) from Nkuhungu hit the passenger train after brake failure. The RPC said the passenger train got the accident yesterday morning. It was en route Kigoma- Mwanza-Katavi to Dar es Salaam and had six passenger cabins, whereas two of the cabins with numbers 3648 and 3607 were involved in the accident. Dodoma Referral hospital Regional Medical Officer, Dr James Charles, said they had received 25 injured persons, but most of them were due to accident shock. “After medical examination eight persons were admitted and 17 others were discharged.” However, the hospital medical officer in-charge, Dr Abdul Pumzi, said later on the day that, five patients had been discharged and they were remaining with three of them, whose condition needed close supervision. Dr Pumzi named those admitted as Pili Majaliwa (40), Launcia Kilini (38) Deus Enock (4), who had fractures and severe injuries. Deputy Minister for Works, Transport and Communications Elias Kwandikwa visited the accident scene and said a rescue team was lifting the cabins, which overturned. Moreover, he said, the TRC management has been instructed to know the extent of the damage caused and cause of the accident and renovate the damaged rail so that transport services could resume.
