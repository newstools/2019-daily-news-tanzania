He said they need the General Meeting in order to sort out several challenges the club is facing at the moment. Biashara United have 120 officially registered member s. Josiah urged the management to ensure they follow the club’s constitution, adding, during the club general meeting they will need to know how the club operated in ended season. Another club member, Alhaji Majogoro said the leadership didn’t call the meeting for a very long time something which he claims not proper.
