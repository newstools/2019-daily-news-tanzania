JOHN Bocco’s Manager, Jemedari Said has expressed his shock on reports that the towering striker has signed for two clubs. In fact, the manager said he has no clue about the deal between Bocco and a South African Premier League side Polokwane City. “I’m not aware of any deal signed by the player and Polokwane City. All that I know and aware of is that Bocco has signed a contract extension with his current club, Simba. “I was among the people who witnessed the signing of contract extension which was held on May 17th this year,” he disclosed. And, according to the manager, Bocco’s current contract with Simba is set to expire on Saturday and the extension will take effect from there. Bocco is currently with national squad, Taifa Stars in Alexandria, ahead of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), finals to be stage from June 21st to July 19th this year. Jemedari has brushed aside the so called Polokwane City contract with Bocco and has disclosed that he awaits the player to return from AFCON assignment to get his side of the story about the matter. On his part, Chairman of Soccer Players' Union of Tanzania, SPUTANZA, Musa Kisoky clarified that Bocco was still legit Simba player. He said the South African side Polokwane City has breached FIFA transfer rules and regulations, concerning players who have remained with six months before contract expires. A ccording to Kisoky, Polokwane City were required to notify Simba as parent club on their intention to sign Bocco, who was still legally owned by the club during the period which they (Polokwane) signed pre-contract with the player. On Tuesday, reports from South Africa surfaced claiming that Polokwane City, who finished fifth in Absa Premiership in the 2018/19 season, have secured Bocco’s signature as part of bolstering their squad ahead of the new season.
