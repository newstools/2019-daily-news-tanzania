DEPUTY Minister for Energy, Ms Subira Mgalu has directed the Rural Energy Authority (REA) and the national power entity, Tanesco, to give priority to social delivery service facilities when connecting power in rural areas. She gave the directive during a meeting with REA and Tanesco officials in Dodoma to discuss various issues regarding the implementation of REA projects across the country. Ms Mgalu stressed that public institution and social service delivery facilities such as schools, hospitals and water sources must be given first priority because they served a large number of ordinary Tanzanians. “We should give priority attention to such institutions as they are key facilitators of social service delivery,” said Ms Mgalu Opening the meeting, Minister Medard Kalemani stressed the need for local purchases of power connection equipment to fast track project implementation. He said all equipment for the power projects, especially rural electrification, must be from the local suppliers and companies to save time and money. Dr Kalemani also directed REA and Tanesco managements to address all complaints and queries from their clients for effective implementation of rural electrification. He said they must know that the issue of power supply for industries is the nation’s priority, and they must therefore ensure that those in need are served well. Dr Kalemani gave a threemonth timeframe for Tanesco district, regional and zonal managers to submit reports of industries connected to power in their respective areas. “You must submit connection fees to industries before they start production so that they make payments and get connected so that at the end of the day you don’t shoulder any blames,” he remarked.
