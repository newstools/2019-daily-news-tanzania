TANZANIA Agricultural Research Institute (TARI) has received 297m/- from Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH) to renovate its Makutupora Centre laboratory. Head of TARI Makutupora Centre Dr Cornel Masawe noted here yesterday during a media tour of the centre that the laboratory renovation project is complete by 90 per cent, saying the grape farming dedicated laboratory will also be equipped with modern research apparatus. “The facility will help farmers to produce grapes with recommended sugar content to enable wine manufacturers to produce the best wines,” said Dr Masawe. Dr Masawe informed further that plans were underway to embark on a special training programme which will include a series of theoretical and practical training to provide farmers and extension officers with key knowledge on how profitably to grow grapes. “The initiative will also see grape farmers empowered over modern ways to process grapes into juice,” he observed. He said the programme will also support research projects to produce varieties of best grape seeds, adding that TARI has already started to disseminate knowledge on agronomic practices among grape farmers and extension officers in Bunda, Geita and Same districts. Supervisor of grape demonstration farm at the centre Richard Malle implored grape farmers to use the centre to get knowledge on modern grape farming, saying the centre has a good number of experts in the cash crop. He underscored the need for the government to continue investing heavily in the grape farming, noting that Tanzania is the only country with ideal weather to have two grape harvest farming in a year. Mr Malle observed that the country has potential weather to produce grapes with high sugar, which is ideal for wine making. TARI Spokesperson Sebastian Kandila said the centre will always remain at the forefront in improving the grapes sector through innovations and implementation of key research projects.
