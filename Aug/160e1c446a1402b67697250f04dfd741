AS the Local Government and General Elections draw close, women are being encouraged not to remain behind, but instead contest at all levels for leadership posts to narrow current gender gap. “Please do not have any fear, come forward and contest for local leadership posts, be they for a Member of Parliament (MP), House of Representative, and even the top position in the country (President). Do not hesitate,” said different Women Rights Activists ahead of the preparation for the 2020 general elections. Mr Ali Haji Ubwa, one of them campaigning under the slogan ‘Men-for-change’ in collaboration with the Tanzania Media Women Association (TAMWA), said in a meeting that with women at the forefront, many opportunities are waiting for them to exploit. Mr Ubwa said that the wrong perception that women are incapable and incompetent when holding any political position is baseless, and urged the public to abandon them. He said that there are women who are preparing to join in the race, but are being discouraged and even threatened to contest by some fellow women and men, who want to maintain a patriarchal system. Patriarchy is a social system in which men hold primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property. “It is high time men support women to take up the position for they have proved beyond doubt that they can perform even better than some men,” he added, while also encouraging them to stand firm for their rights. Commenting, Ms Asha Abdi from TAMWA has said that they launched the countrywide awareness election campaign as a program to encourage women to learn and seek advice earlier as they prepare to contest in the coming elections.
