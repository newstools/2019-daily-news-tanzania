BENEFICIARIES of the just ended two-day Unified Sports Coach training in Mwanza have labelled it crucial for promoting inclusion culture among intellectual disabled people and ablebodied people in society. The coaches have been tasked to implement the Play Unified, Learn Unified project, set to hit the ground running soon funded by Stavros Niarchos Foundation (SNF), from their respective schools and it attracted ten coaches drawn from five Primary Schools in Mwanza. The project has specifically been arranged to accelerate the unified way of living for all people, regardless of their various biological differences through using sports as the main tool of fostering the inclusion. Speaking to the ‘Daily News’ after the training, one of the participants Happy Fupi, who is a Sports coach at Igoma Primary School here said she acquired important lessons from the training. “Previously, I was unable to control intellectual challenged people with their normal colleagues when playing together but through this training, I will now be able to balance them in the right way,” she said. She added that it is better to see that the project is targeting young intellectual challenged persons, who she said are facing many challenges as they grow up. She said the community now will start seeing them as normal human beings capable to bring positive changes. Also, in his remarks, another participant Michael Menard of Pasiansi Primary School said Play Unified, Learn Unified project will help a lot to facilitate love between intellectual disabled people and their friends.
