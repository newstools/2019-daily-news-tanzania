MINISTER for Energy, Dr Medard Kalemani, has directed top officials from Rural Energy Agency (REA), Tanesco and a contractor tasked with electrifying Milepa Village in Rukwa Region to ensure the work is completed by September 16, this year. The officials under the minister’s notice include REA Acting Director General (DG), Amos Maganga and Tanesco Manager for Southern-West Highland Zone Salome Nkondola. The project is being implemented by a Dar es Salaam-based contractor, Nakuroi Investment Ltd. Dr Kalemani made it clear to them that they should consider resigning from their posts should they fail to meet the deadline. Dr Kalemani said he was compelled to give such directive after learning that the contractor only started digging holes for electricity poles after discovering that the minister was about to visit the village. Before Dr Kalemani and his entourage arrived at Milepa Village from Myunga Village in Kalambo District, he witnessed dozens of manual workers from Nakuroi contractor busy digging holes for erecting electricity poles. “Though this village was initially not on a government plan to be connected to power through REA III Project, since last year the government directed Milepa Village to be connected to power, but the directive was ignored since then,” said Dr Kalemani. “All those, who I have mentioned must make sure until September 16 at about 8:00pm Milepa Village is connected to electricity short of that all of them must resign from their posts,” directed Dr Kalemani.
