I&M Bank has ventured into custodial and investment services, thanks to increased financial and capital market opportunities in the country. The regional lender, with 15 years’ experience, introduced the service yesterday to spice up custodial business which now is served by seven out of 40 commercial banks on the land. The I& M Bank Assistant Manager for Custodial and Investment Services, Mr Frank Bunuma, said the demand for custodial service has increased over time thus pushing them to offer the service. “We decided to introduce the service after realising that there is now increased demand from investors wanting such assistances,” Mr Bunuma said. He said the new service is also aimed at connecting investors to the markets not only in Tanzania but also across the East Africa and at affordable rates. Also, the bank will be providing proxy service to represent investors in annual general meeting at times of their busy schedules. Unlike Kenya, where I& M provides such services, the lender said Tanzania is dragged in the region due to limited number of custodial experts. Capital Market and Securities Authority (CMSA) Chief Executive Officer Mr Nicodemus Mkama said increasing number of players offering custodians in the capital markets will facilitate and simplify cross border trading of securities by foreign investors. “Availability of custodial and investment services provides support to local and international investors who want to invest in our country,” Mr Mkama, who was the guest of the launching said. “The launching of custodial and investment service of I& M marks another milestone in the development of the capital market in Tanzania… ,” Mr Mkama said. He said for a country which is determined to step into industrial economy, custodial and investment services are increasingly important. Tanzania wants to attain a semi-industrial economy by 2025 and reaching that step investors need capitals and markets.
