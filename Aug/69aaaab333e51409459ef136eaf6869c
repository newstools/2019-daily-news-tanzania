IN efforts to promote breastfeeding in the country, Ilala Municipality is continuing with free education to pregnant and breast feeding mothers to improve health of babies. That was said yesterday in Dar es Salaam by Ilala Municipality Nutrition officer, Ms Flora Mgimba: “Adding that the main aim of celebrating breastfeeding week is to create awareness to mother and community on the importance of breastfeeding for better health of the mother and her child.” World Breastfeeding Week is celebrated every year from 1 to 7 August to encourage breastfeeding to improve babies’ health globally, with this year’s theme read: “Empower Parents, Enable Breastfeeding.” “There is every reason for Tanzania to celebrate World Breastfeeding Week to heighten awareness to the community on gender equality, laws and regulations, which can protect, develop and helps breastfeeding practices to improve the lives of mothers and child,” she said. Mr Mgimba equally advised mothers to continue breastfeeding their babies for two or more years after birth to scale up health of their babies and protect them from various diseases. She further said that the practice increases breastfeeding as envisioned in ‘nearuniversal levels to save more than 800, 000 lives every year with the majority being children under 6 months. Breastfeeding decreases the risk of mothers developing breast cancer, ovarian cancer, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. It is estimated that increased breastfeeding could avert 20, 000 maternal deaths each year likely to get breast cancer. World Health Organization (WHO), recommends that exclusive breastfeeding should start within one hour after birth until a baby is 6 months old. However, nutritious complementary foods should then be added alongside breastfeed for up to 2 years or beyond.
