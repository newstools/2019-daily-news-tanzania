THE Family Federation for World Peace (FFWP), a non governmental organization, said it would bring 50 tourists from Japan and Korea next week in efforts to promote tourist attractions in Asia as a continent. The distribution of the arrivals by region indicates that Europe continued to account for the largest share in 2017, followed by Asia and the Pacific, the Americas, Africa, and the Middle East. The civil society said that the visitors would also come in the country on charity grounds and attend marriage and family peace festivals in Dar es Salaam. “We have been inviting them every year and their number has increased from 7 last year after they spread information on Tanzania’s wonderful attractions to their fellows,” Mr Stylos Simba, FFWP National Coordinator. They developed interests on the country’s tourist attractions after visiting Ngorongoro, Mikumi and Serengeti National Parks, Mr Simba noted. Adding that this year a group of 50 will visit Mikumi National Park. One of them is a film maker who would also be taking pictures to promote Tanzania’s tourist attractions in their countries. Speaking over the festival, Mr Simba explained that they have invited President John Magufuli as guest of honour at the event to be held on 31st August. “We are still waiting for confirmation from the Head of State to grace our event,” he said, noting that it would involve over 40,000 families, who have been educated on how to maintain peace at family level. The NGO focuses on educating families countrywide on peace to avoid matrimonial disputes. So far, the organization has spread wings in eight regions of Dar es Salaam, Morogoro, Mbeya, Arusha and Mwanza.
