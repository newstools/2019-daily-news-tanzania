TANZANIA Civil Aviation Authority (TCAA), has pledged to use the upcoming international aviation security symposium to promote Mt Kilimanjaro and other tourist attractions in the country. The Director General for the TCAA Mr Hamza Johari said here that they were banking on the high profile meeting slated for Montreal, Canada later next month to woo in more tourists to visit the country, particularly Africa’s rooftop. “We’ll use the rare occasion to promote the attraction, highlighting to the delegates its beauty and the challenges of conquering Africa’s highest mountain,” assured Mr Johari shortly after his descent from the Mountain at the weekend. Mr Johari who led a group of 21 others for a five-day expedition to mark the International Civil Aviation Organization of the United Nations (ICAO), 75th anniversary noted that exploring the mountain’s beauty of natural wonder would be any tourist’s desire and a once-ina- lifetime experience, adding that the country’s aviation authority would be honored to take up the task of marketing the world’s highest freestanding mountain stands vigil over Tanzania’s untamed landscapes. “The global symposium will be a crucial platform to highlight the beauty of the sight-seeing tourist attraction site,” he said. The third annual Global Aviation Security Symposium 2019 (AVSEC2019), will highlight ICAO Global Aviation Security Plan implementation success stories, innovative approaches and best practices from States and industry stakeholders. It will also feature speeches, panels, activities, and real-time polls will focus on the challenges encountered in improving AVSEC, and the mechanisms employed to overcome those issues. In her rejoinder, a conservator with Kilimanjaro National Park (KINAPA), Ms Angela Nyaki commended the country’s aviation watchdog for its zeal of marketing Tanzania’s tourist attractions, further challenging the authority to inculcate a habit of scaling the Mountain. “Your expedition will be remembered for a great team spirit, do not get tired of climbing Mt Kilimanjaro, if anything you should make it a habit,” she challenged.
