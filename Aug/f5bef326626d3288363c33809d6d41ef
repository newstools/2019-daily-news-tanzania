TANZANIAN researchers have launched a special project to monitor sea water acidity in the Indian Ocean by installing special “floating sensor” to collect data, towards minimising the impact of ocean acidification. The project worth 200m/-which would be managed by researchers from the Tanzania Fish Research Institute (TAFIRI), under the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries will last for three years and sponsored by Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association (WIOMSA). Addressing stakeholders at TAFIRI headquarters in Dar es Salaam over the weekend which included representatives from Tanzania Metrology Authority (TMA), National Environmental Management Council (NEMC) and leadership of Beaches Management Unit (BMU), a researcher from the Ministry of Fisheries, Dr Hassan Nikuli, said that, the project will enable the government acquire correct data to report SDG number 14.3 as per directive of UN for all member countries. SDG 14 targets to conserve and sustainably use ocean, sea and marine resources for sustainable development and SDG 14.3 emphasizes minimization and addressing the impact of ocean acidification. “As the government launches this project to monitor water acidity in our area of the Indian Ocean by installing special floating sensor, researchers would be able to acquire proper data of acidity control rate in sea water and make it easy to submit annual reports to the UN,” he said.
