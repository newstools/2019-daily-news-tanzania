HYDOM Lutheran Hospital in Manyara region is in the final stages to stage a charity run christened Run for Life marathon on August 10, this year. The race, according to the organiser, aims at raising funds for the hospital to improve its infrastructure and medical services. The hospital’s Managing Director Dr Emanuel Nuwas, believes the move to boost the hospital infrastructure and medical services will help in infant mortality which has been a major problem in the developing nations. “Poor infrastructure and medical services have affected our hospitals in Manyara region, hence we will use the funds to sort out these challenges,” said the director. According to Dr Nuwas, the organisers have invited friends, government and private institutions and health stakeholders to participate in the event and donate to the project.
