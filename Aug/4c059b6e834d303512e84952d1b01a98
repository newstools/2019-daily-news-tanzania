TANZANIANS have been invited to visit the SADC industrial exhibitions so that they may learn new skills and creativity in the industrial sector. The exhibitions are scheduled for August 5 at Julius Nyerere International Conference Centre (JNICC), Karimjee and Gymkhana grounds in the city. The Ministry of Industries and Trade said on Monday in a statement that all citizens were invited to the exhibitions so that they could learn new things from others. According to the statement, as the government strives for building an industrial economy, the SADC industrial exhibitions provide an opportunity to Tanzanians to experience new things from other countries. “We invite all people to the exhibitions. SADC Industrialisation Week will enable Tanzanians to know various business and investment opportunities found among SADC member countries,” reads part of the statement signed by the ministry’s Information Officer, Jesse Chonde. Earlier, this week Chief Secretary John Kijazi appealed to members of the public to utilise SADC Industrialisation Week effectively, saying it was a golden opportunity for Tanzanians, who wished to improve their businesses and set up investment plans. He asked owners of hotels, transportation companies and others to ensure they utilised rare opportunities during the SADCsummit and throughout the year when President John Magufuli would be chairing the SADC bloc. The Chief Secretary said this, when he visited JNICC to inspect ongoing preparations for SADC Industrialisation Week and the summit. On August 17, 1992, at their summit held in Windhoek, SADC Heads of State and Government signed the SADC Treaty and Declaration that effectively transformed the Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC) into the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
