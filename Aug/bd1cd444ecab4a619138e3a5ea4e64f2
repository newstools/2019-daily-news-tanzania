STAVROS Niarchos Foundation (SNF), have been commended for coming up with Play Unified, Learn Unified initiative which promote unified culture between intellectual disabled people and their colleagues. This was uttered yesterday by Town Education Officer (TEO), of Primary Schools in Newala Town Council, Mohammed Mwenda as he officially opened the two-day Unified Coach training which climaxes here today. “To say the truth, this project has timely arrived as we all would like to see that people live happily together regardless of their biological differences,” Mwanda said. He added that sports is the number one tool that encourages inclusive culture since it has capacity to bring many people together hence what SNF is doing should highly be commended. “For a long time, we have been looking to see this project implemented in schools, we have people who love sports only that they lack good platform to make that culture possible as such, I have big hopes that the target of the initiative will be easily achieved,” he said. Moreover, the TEO clarified that the Ministry of Education is doing everything possible to provide good learning environment for intellectual challenged learners through provision of friendly infrastructures. He then called the trainees to fully grasp whatever the instructors of the training were teaching so that they can be good coaches in the schools where the project will be implemented. “If you successfully apply all the skills you are learning, it will be a credit for the country and this will make the donors of the project happy to continue funding it,” said him. Only two games which are football and volleyball will be played during the entire project period. From here, five primary schools which have been selected to undertake the training are Shangani, Kitangali, Migongo, Lulindi and Luchingu. Tanzania is the second country in Africa to embrace the project after Kenya and it is expected to last for three years
