MONDULI District has surpassed revenue target after registering a collection of 102 per cent in 2018/19. The district collected 3.5bn/- surpassing its 3.41bn/- target set, mainly contributed by Mto wa Mbu township. Speaking during the special meeting with business people in Monduli and Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) officers, the Monduli District Commissioner, Idd Hassan Kimanta said large part of the revenue collection was from Mto wa Mbu township. “Mto-wa-Mbu is not only a gateway to Ngorongoro Conservation, Lake Manyara and Serengeti National Parks, but also is a busy town with trade, tourism and agriculture,” he said. TRA Arusha Regional Manager, Faustine Mdessa said his office is currently visiting traders to get their views and opinions on how the taxmen can assist them to perform better as far as their business activities in relation to tax remittance issues are concerned. “We have set aside each Thursday for TRA to receive complaints and suggestions from local business entities and traders in order to clear all barriers to trade,” said Mr Mdessa. One of the traders, Dorah Kipuyo said they were impressed by the TRA efforts to break the wall between business people and the Taxman. “And we have also benefitted with special awareness raising training from TRA on how local traders can keep business records which is important in improving our daily transactions and undertakings,” she added. Other traders in Monduli were of the opinion that the Revenue Authority should increase the frequency of meeting with traders because challenges keep on increasing calling for interventions.
