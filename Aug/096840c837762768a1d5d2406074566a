THE Tanzania Forest Fund ( TaFF) has supported more than 580 forest conservation projects since its establishment in July 2011. The revelation was made here by TaFF Projects Officer Patricia Manongi at the just ended Nanenane exhibitions adding that many regions have summited applications for forest conservations, beyond their expectations. "Many regions are now mobilised to embark on forest conservation, which has been picking up every year since the establishment of the Fund, and by June this year, around 580 projects have been funded,” she further said. The officer noted that TaFF started its activities with 2bn/-, but its subsidy has reached 12bn/- by this year and currently expects to fund around 100 projects out of more than 350 applications pending in this year. Starting sketchily with 52 projects in 2011, it has realised positive contributions every year and that indicates that many regions are increasingly becoming aware on their expectations to conserve their forests. Initially, TaFF used to provide grants to support forest resources’ protection, conservation and management, which in turn have improved livelihoods of many communities surrounding them. June 2018 statistics cite Njombe (83 projects), Morogoro (58), Coast (58), Ruvuma (53),  Iringa (49), Tanga (34), and Kilimanjaro (27) as seven regions which have been supported. Regions with fewer projects include Katavi (3), Geita (3), Mtwara (4), Kigoma (7), and Manyara (7) as well as Dar es Salaam (8). "Good news is that many regions are compliant with procedures and conditions governing these grants, and this makes it impossible for TaFF to provide them to all the regions, which submitted applications," said Ms Manongi. Citing as an example, she further said that in this year, more than 300 applications have been submitted and about 100 have been sorted out as the best waiting nomination.
