IN a bid to boot sunflower production, the Tanzania Agricultural Research Institute (TARI) plans to introduce three high quality seed varieties. This was disclosed during a recent round table meeting by National Coordinator for Sunflower Research from Ilonga TARI Centre Frank Reuben. He said TARI would soon be providing farmers with the new seeds. “Ilonga TARI Centre has introduced a sunflower breeding programme geared towards improving sunflower production in the country. The programme will provide farmers with new sunflower seeds,” said the national coordinator. The meeting, which was organised by the Agricultural Markets Development Trust (AMDT), brought together sunflower farmers and key agricultural stakeholders to discuss sunflower farming development in the country. Mr Reuben said Ilonga TARI Centre was on course to develop improved sunflower seeds through the programme, saying the goal of the strategic plan was to uplift sunflower farming. Chief Executive Officer of Agricultural Seed Agency, Dr Sophia Kashenge, said the programme would play a key role in sunflower production, saying the introduction of new seeds would provide high quality sunflower oil. She pointed out a shortage of high quality sunflower seed was a big challenge to sunflower farmers in the country.
