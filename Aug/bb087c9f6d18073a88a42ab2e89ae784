However, the Board Chairman, Mr Fortunatu Magambo said that during the year that ended December 2 0 18 the company’s profit before tax decreased by 44 per cent to 195.7 8 million also in comparison to 20 17 due to lower dividend income and increased costs. “ After-tax-profit increased by 4 9 per cent to 3 66.57 million, it was as a result of recognizing tax credits relating to income from dividends. During the reporting period the Company diversified about 2 0 per cent (4 .3 billion) of its equity portfolio into G overnment bonds, which boosted interest income significantly to absorb the declining dividend income,” he added. The chairman also told the meeting that the portfolio of the company’s equity investments “suffered total depreciation in value by 2 ,0 3 0 million,” after taking into account the disposal of 110 ,0 0 0 TBL shares during the period. “ This was due to share price depreciation, which affected most of the DSE listed companies, where the company holds stake,” Mr Magambo further assured the meeting. Equally, he pointed out to the shareholders that steps were being taken to optimize the company’s return on equity. The meeting approved a dividend of 2 .54 per share for the year ending December 31, 2 0 18, the same rate paid to shareholders for the year ending December 20 17 .
