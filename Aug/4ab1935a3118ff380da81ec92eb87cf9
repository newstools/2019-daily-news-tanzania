THE prosecution yesterday displayed before the Kisutu Resident Magistrate’s Court in Dar es Salaam two video tapes allegedly showing senior officials of the opposition political party Chadema, including National Chairman Freeman Mbowe, uttering seditious incitements and conducting illegal demonstrations. In order to view the tapes, Principal Resident Magistrate Thomas Simba, who is conducting the criminal sedition trial of the party’s nine officials, had to move to Kisutu Training and Information Resource Centre where some enabling equipment were used to facilitate the session. The sixth prosecution witness, police officer Corporal Charles, displayed the video recording tapes under the guidance of the prosecuting team comprising Principal State Attorneys Faraja Nchimbi and Zainabu Mango as well as Senior State Attorney Wankyo Simon and State Attorney Jacqueline Nyantori. In the tapes, Mbowe is recorded to have addressed the public at an area said to be Buibui Grounds on February 16, 2019, while winding up campaigns for Parliamentary by-elections for Kinondoni Constituency held on February 17, 2019. After addressing the public, Mbowe is recorded as encouraging people to move together to the office of the returning officer at Magomeni Area to push for the release of recognition letters of election agents. Others at the rally are the party’s Secretary General Vicent Mashinji , John Mnyika, the Deputy Secretary General (Mainland), Salum Mwalimu, Deputy Secretary General (Zanzibar) and also candidate for the by-elections and Peter Msigwa Member of Parliament for Iringa Urban.
