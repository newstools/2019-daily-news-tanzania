AT least ten coaches from Morogoro are set to benefit from the two- day Unified Sports Coach training, scheduled to begin here today. It is the continuation of Special Olympics Tanzania (SO-T) programme with funding from Stavros Niarchos Foundation (SNF), under ‘Play Unified, Learn Unified’ initiative which is drilling coaches from five regions in the country who will implement the project once it starts operating soon. So far, SO-T team has already visited and trained coaches in Mwanza and Tanga regions with Morogoro being the third region to host the same training ahead of Mtwara and Dar es Salaam. Participants, who have embraced the seminar in Mwanza and Tanga regions, have labelled it essential as far as promoting inclusive culture among intellectual disabled people and their normal colleagues is concerned. Briefing the ‘Daily News’ yesterday, SNF Project Coordinator Kelvin Mwise said they expect to see another impressive turnout from participants here. “It is our hope that the level of attendance will continue to be overwhelming as witnessed from the past areas we have visited. It is encouraging to see that coaches are actively participating in the training sessions, which is being conducted in both theory and practical,” he said. In terms of challenges, Mwise said sports infrastructure in most primary schools they have toured remain a big obstacle but said they will do whatever necessary to make sure that the project runs smoothly.
