TANZANIA and Morocco have been urged to initiate broader framework of cooperation by establishing a Joint Permanent Commission (JPC) between two countries to increase pace for greater cooperation. This was said by the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation, Dr Damas Ndumbaro, during the event to mark the 20th anniversary of leadership of King Mohamed VI of Morocco held at the embassy in Dar es Salaam over the weekend. “The JPC will provide an effective platform to monitor implementation of the agreements we already have in place,” he said. The event was attended by Ambassadors, High Commissioners and Heads of Diplomatic Organizations, Tanzania government officials and staff members of the embassy. Dr Ndumbaro said Tanzania is proud of the continued cooperation between two countries after the royal visit which marked the beginning of a new era in bilateral relations. “On behalf of Dr John Magufuli, President of Tanzania, the government and the people I would like to extend to you, the government and the people of the Kingdom of Morocco, congratulations for marking the 20th anniversary,” the deputy minister said. He said the historic visit made by King Mohammed VI to Tanzania two years ago opened the countries commitment to enhance cooperation in areas of agriculture and fisheries, energy, tourism, industries, railway, trade, insurance, health, gas, tea blending, political consultation, economic, science and cultural cooperation. Abdellilah Benryane, the Ambassador of the Kingdom of Morocco to Tanzania said the anniversary was a momentous opportunity to evaluate the progress made during those 20 years and to reflect on the nation’s successes and failures and to learn from previous achievements and shortcomings.
