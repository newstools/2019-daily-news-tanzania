WITH just two days remaining for the Southern African Community Development (SADC) Summit to start, the Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority (Dawasa) has assured city residents and visitors of constant water supply. Tanzania is hosting the 39th SADC Summit this weekend with President John Magufuli expected to take over the 16-national regional economic integration body chairmanship from his Namibian counterpart, Dr Hage Geingob. “The meeting is taking place at a time Dawasa has already improved water supply in some parts of Dar es Salaam and we remain committed that water in the city will remain uninterrupted during and after the summit,” reads part of a press statement released by Dawasa in Dar es Salaam yesterday. The statement, which quotes Dawasa Chief Executive Officer Cyprian Luhemeja, says the authority repaired water infrastructure in many parts of the city and a system has been put in place to ensure regular water supply all the time. “Dawasa has improved water supply in Dar es Salaam and Coast regions. We have repaired and replaced old infrastructure and constructed a new reservoir…all this aims at ensuring constant water flow,” Mr Luhemeja is quoted as saying. Dawasa is responsible for the provision of water supply in Dar es Salaam City and neighbouring areas of Kibaha and Bagamoyo.
