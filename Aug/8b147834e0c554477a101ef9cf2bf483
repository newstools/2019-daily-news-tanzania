AS the 39th SADC Summit of Head of State and Government is expected to kick off this Saturday, the Police Force in Dar es Salaam has said security has been intensified in all parts of the region. Speaking to the media in Dar es Salaam yesterday, Special Zone Police Commander Lazaro Mambosasa said they had started strengthening routine patrols throughout the city. According to him, today they will start using helicopters besides vehicles and horses to ensure security is strengthened all times the important gathering is in progress. He noted that in previous days they had taken several initiatives to ensure security was strengthened by banning motorcycles without special permits to cross the city centre. Other initiatives include banning installation of and using sirens and emergency lights on private vehicles, tricycles and motorcycles, which have been causing nuisance on public roads. “We have mounted a special operation and have so far apprehended 126 motor vehicles, including 87 motorcycles, 13 tricycles and 26 cars that have been installed with sirens and emergency lights,” said Mr Mambosasa. He noted that various legal measures had been taken against offenders. He warned all those planning to defy lawful orders that the police were at work and would not tolerate any kind of criminal act. “As people have been hearing that Tanzania is the haven of peace, while out there, this has to be maintained even at this important forum,” he noted. Mr Mambosasa disclosed that there were enough police deployed in various parts of Dar es Salaam.
