GENERAL Electric (GE), and Songas yesterday announced the successful completion of the upgrade of the entire GE fleet that will increase the power plant’s efficiency and reliability, enabling Songas to maintain the plant in the most economical way possible. These technology upgrades “We are very pleased with GE’s execution because it was completed safely and ahead of schedule, with great commitment and consistency across the four LM6000 units,” said Nigel Whittaker, Managing Director, Songas Limited. Songas Ubungo Power Plant provides more than 20 percent of the grid connected power in Tanzania; upgrade of three GE’s LM6000PA and one LM6000PC Aero derivative gas turbines Improved Plant Efficiency and Reliability. He added, “The successful completion of this project not only improves Songas’ performance levels, but through the additional reliable supply of electricity, continues to contribute to the economic development of the country, making a significant difference in the lives of Tanzanians,” GE’s upgrade of the four LM6000PA gas turbines to LM6000PC significantly improves the current LM6000 fleet. GE’s SPRINT (SPRay- INTercooling), technology, installed on two of the four units, increases gas turbine performance, improves power flexibility, enhances the combustion system, improves fuel efficiency, extends maintenance intervals for the combust or, hot section and major overhaul and lowers maintenance costs. “Over the past 15 years, Songas and GE have collaborated on the Ubungo power plant, and we’re excited to help enhance operations, increase capacity, and deliver the principles of safety first, quality foremost and operational excellence,” said Elisee Sezan, CEO for GE’s Gas Power business in sub– Saharan Africa. “Our goal is to bring longterm value to our customers and their power plants, like Songas, to maintain it in the most efficient way possible and, ultimately, contribute to Tanzania’s economic and social development,” Sezan said. In 2017, GE signed a multiyear agreement to upgrade gas turbines at the Songas Ubungo power plant in Tanzania. GE’s LM6000-PF dual fuel gas turbines power the 150-MW Kinyerezi power plant, which also has a multiyear agreement with GE for the long-term, reliable operation of its power plant.
