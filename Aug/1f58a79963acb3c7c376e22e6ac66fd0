RORYA District Commissioner (DC) Simon Chacha has called upon Tanzanians living outside the country to contribute towards development projects in the country to realise their quick implementations. The DC made the appeal yesterday here while receiving 300 bags of cement worth 4.5m/- from a private development stakeholder towards the construction of the new Rorya District Hospital. He said that such local implementations are in line with President John Magufuli’s pledge to the residents, especially during last year trip in Tarime. In the trip Rorya Member of Parliament (MP), Lameck Airo hinted to the President that lack of such facility was subjecting the residents to walk long distance to Musoma or Kenya. In response President Magufuli pledged that his government would, by this year start disbursing 1.5bn/- to construct a modern District hospital in the area. The President had said that for the past four years, the fifth phase government has disbursed 400m/- and 500m/- to rehabilitate Utegi and Kinesi Health centres respectively. ‘’This is evident in the past four years citing the speed and accuracy exemplified by the fifth phase administration under the stewardship of Dr Magufuli. In Rorya District alone, the government funded a total of 2.4bn/- to health projects that is a remarkable performance ever reached since the demarcation of Rorya from the Tarime District over ten years ago,” said Mr Chacha
