TANZANIAN Mbwana Samatta of Belgium’s KRC Genk will face champions Liverpool, Napoli and Salzburg in the 2019-20 Champions League group stage. Yesterday’s draw in Monaco pitted the European Cup holders against the sides from Italy, Austria and Belgium respectively in Group E to begin their defence of the trophy. The Reds, of course, last faced Napoli in last season’s group stage. After a 1-0 reversal at Stadio San Paolo in October, Mohamed Salah scored the only goal of the game in the return at Anfield on matchday six to send Jürgen Klopp’s team into the knockout phase. Liverpool have never before taken on Salzburg or Genk previously in competitive or friendly competition; however, Sadio Mane and Naby Keita both used to represent the Austrian club. Manchester City have been drawn in Group C alongside Shakhtar Donetsk, Dinamo Zagreb and Atalanta. It is City’s ninth-consecutive year in the Champions League main draw, currently the longest unbroken sequence of any Premier League side. Tottenham have been drawn against five-time winners Bayern Munich in the Champions League group stage. Spurs, who were beaten in their first ever Champions League final last season, are joined in Group B by Olympiakos and Serbian champions Red Star Belgrade. The group stage will begin on September 17/18 and conclude on December 10/11.
