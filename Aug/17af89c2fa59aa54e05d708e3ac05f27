At the end of 90 minutes, Tanzanite’s Diana Msemwa was nominated the best player of the match. Tanzanite is participating in the tournament as a guest nation and drawn in group B alongside Botswana, Zambia and Eswatini. Tanzanite Head Coach, Bakari Shime is seeking to guide his team to become the first guest side at a COSAFA event to walk away with the main trophy. Shime was pleased with his team’s performance, especially in the second half and he sees a bright future in the coming games. After seeing off Botswana in their opener, Tanzanite will then face Eswatini on Monday, before closing out their pool play with a clash against Zambia on Tuesday. The top two teams in each pool will advance to the semifinals. As for Tanzania, Botswana is using the majority of the Under-17 team, along with a few Under-20 players as part of the team process to learn and grow. This is the inaugural staging of the regional championship in this age group, despite COSAFA having managed the bi-annual Region 5 Games that are played at an Under-20 level for women.
