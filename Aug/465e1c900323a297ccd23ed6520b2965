SPECIAL committee for collection of East Africans’ views on the proposed political federation has started its work. The team—the Constitution Forming Committee—which Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni flagged off in Kampala yesterday—is scheduled to traverse the region, seeking opinions from the 174 million East Africans on the envisioned political entity. Briefing reporters here recently, East African Community’s (EAC) Deputy Secretary General in charge of Planning and Infrastructure Engineer Steven Mlote said the special committee has hit the ground running. “The collection of the views from East Africans is well underway in Uganda where the special committee will crisscross the region in the process,” hinted the EAC Deputy Secretary General. According to Engineer Mlote, the committee has six months to complete the mission and submit a report to the EAC summit in the upcoming meet in November this year. Detailing on the special committee, Engineer Mlote said it comprises of two experts and draftsmen from each of the six partner states. The issue of attaining a political federation has been toping the items of agenda of most EAC heads of state summits in recent years.
