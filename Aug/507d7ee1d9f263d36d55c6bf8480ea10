NEWLY appointed Minister of State in the Vice President’s Office (Union Affairs and Environment) George Simbachawene said the post fits him well and aligns with his passion for environmental conservation. Mr Simbachawene said this at the sixth Green Growth Platform, stressing that President John Magufuli had appointed him to the right ministry and promised to deliver to conserve and protect the environment. The minister, who hardly has two weeks in office, said he had been longing for such work that fitted well his passion for environment conservation and protection. However, he noted that lack of coordination among stakeholders in environmental conservation and protection was a drawback to the ministry. “Coordination in the environmental sector is a problem and the time has come for concerted effort so that we may do justice to the sector,” said Mr Simbachawene. He noted that there should be coordinated efforts to minimise deforestation and water source pollution, which to a great extent contributed to environmental degradation. Equally, Mr Simbachawene urged participants to work as a team on public awareness to promote forest management and sustainable water sources. He also wanted most of the projects to be implemented in rural areas, where the levels of environmental degradation were high by educating members of the public about the danger of environmental degradation and by conserving and protecting the environment for present and future generations. He appealed to Tanzanians to contribute to environmental conservation and protection. “By the end of this year, a national environmental impact assessment report will be released.”
