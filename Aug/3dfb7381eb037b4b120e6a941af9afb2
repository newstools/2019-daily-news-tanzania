THE government through the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism plans to harvest wildlife beasts, including hippopotamuses which have invaded and living in dams surrounded by human settlements in five districts in the country. The wild animals are reported to wreak havoc to the citizens surrounding the dams being key water supplies built by Water Departments. Tanzania Wildlife Authority (TAWA) Conservation Commissioner Dr James Wakibara, addressing reporters on the sidelines of the official closure of a twomonth paramilitary training course at Mlele Centre over the weekend, named some of the districts, which have been invaded by wild animals, including hippos and crocodiles as Mpanda in Katavi, Nkasi in Rukwa, Babati in Manyara and Meatu in Shinyanga regions. Reporters had wanted to know the government efforts to control the large number of hippos, which are reported to have invaded and settled at Milala dam here in municipality and wreck havoc to the citizens. “Already we are aware of the situation and it is at the level of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism for further action, in fact the plan is to harvest them soon...... there are two ways of addressing this problem either to harvest them or remove them and transfer to the distant reserved precincts though it is costly,” noted Dr Wakibara. He further noted that population in many areas has expanded, compelling people to move and settle in areas that were previously settlements for wild animals, causing many disputes.
