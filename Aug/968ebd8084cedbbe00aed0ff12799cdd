TANZANIA Coffee Board (TCB), has encouraged small scale farmers to replace old coffee trees with new variety to maximise their labour and output. TCB Lake Zone Manager, Melkiad Massawe said coffee farmers need to emulate some few fellow farmers who have replaced old trees with high yielding varieties supplied by Tanzania Coffee Research Institute (TACRI), at Maruku, in Bukoba Rural District. The old varieties are also highly susceptible to the coffee major diseases, namely coffee berry disease and coffee leaf rust for Arabica and coffee wilt disease for Robusta. TCB said that one of the major constraints to productivity and development of country’s coffee industry was cultivation old coffee tree varieties produce low yields. Kagera region has low coffee productivity which stands at 500 kilograms per hectare. One of the successful farmers Albert Katagira (60), a resident of Kyerwa District Nyabishenge village, said investing in agribusiness is lucrative and offers a wide range of employment. With guidance from extension officers he has managed to increase coffee production to 1.7 tonnes per hectare, above the national average of 1.5 tons per hectare. Mr Katagira, told the ‘Daily News’ that he owns a 100-hectare of organic Robusta coffee farm. His future plans is to expand the farms to 300 hectares within 2-3 years and also install a coffee processing factory to add value to the crop. Due to his efforts he was selected best Robusta coffee farmer during this year farmers’ day held in Simiyu Region.
