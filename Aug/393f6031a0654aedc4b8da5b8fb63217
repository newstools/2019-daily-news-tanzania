DEPUTY Minister for Industry and Trade Stella Manyanya has directed the Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) to observe ethics and procedures guiding their daily obligations to provide timely and quality services on standards to the customers. “You must work hard and provide services on standards without delay in order to promote the growth of businesses and contribute to economic growth,” she said after visiting the just ended Nanenane exhibitions at the central zone in Dodoma Region. Ms Manyanya emphasized that delivering quality services on standards was important in this period of time as some of the obligation have been entrusted to TBS from the Tanzania Food and Drug Authority (TFDA). On her part, the TBS Marketing Manager, Deborah Haule, said through the farmers’ exhibition event they have provided public education and awareness to manufacturers on various issues regarding standards. “We also used the Nanenane annual event to explain the new obligations transferred to TBS from the TFDA recently,” she said. Furthermore, she said through the farmers’ event they managed to inform small scale entrepreneurs on the free services on accessing quality standard mark aimed at promoting their businesses to compete in the regional and global market. The Minister of State in the President's Office (Regional Administration and Local Governments), Mr Suleiman Jafo, urged entrepreneurs to use efficiently the opportunities in various trade fair and exhibition platforms at the district and regional level to showcase their products in order to capture the wider market.
