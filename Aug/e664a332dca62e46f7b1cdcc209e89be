STUDENTS who received multiple admissions at various higher learning institutions have only two days to confirm one university of their choice before TCU issues another batch of students admitted in various universities for the next academic year. Equally, those who missed out in the first list of admissions for 2019/2020 Academic Year have until this Thursday to re-apply for admissions; TCU said in a statement to the media yesterday. TCU Executive Secretary Professor Charles Kihampa said the first phase of admissions at various universities had been closed and that the names of successful applicants had already been released by the respective universities. However, Prof Kihampa added, there was no cause for alarm for students whose names did not appear in selections during the first batch as the university watchdog opened a new window for them to reapply for the second chance and that TCU had set August 29, 2019 as the deadline. “TCU opened a new window for several groups that did not get admitted at universities during the second round, they include form six graduates and diploma holders who did not apply during the first round, students who accomplished their 2019 Cambridge examinations and whose results had already been released as well as applicants who had been admitted in the previous years but did not show up or dropped out of colleges,’’ he said. T CU explained further that all applications should be forwarded to the respective universities just as it was done during the first phase of applications. “All applicants are reminded that all issues related to admissions or confirmation of the preferred university should be directly communicated to the respective universities and not TCU,’’ added Prof Kihampa. The TCU Executive Secretary said students who received multiple admissions have until August 29, 2019 to confirm one university of their choice and that the list of students who received multiple admissions had been posted in TCU website.
