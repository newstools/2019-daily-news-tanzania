THE International Civil Aviation Organisation of the United Nations (ICAO), will today begin a five-day expedition of hoisting its flag on top of Mt Kilimanjaro. The gesture is in line with the UN’s specialised agency’s 75th anniversary which is commemorated this year. According to the statement availed to the ‘Daily News’ yesterday, today’s trek to Africa’s rooftop will be led by the Director General of Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority (TCAA), Mr Hamza Johari. “Hoisting of the ICAO flag at top of Mt Kilimanjaro will not only be an honor to our country, but will also bring us several advantages, including promotion of aviation and tourism industry in Tanzania,” said Mr Johari in the statement. The expedition team is scheduled to be flagged off at the Marangu Gate, which serves as an entry and exit point of Africa’s highest mountain, a ceremony which will also be graced by ICAO Regional Director for Eastern and Southern Africa, Mr Barry Kashambo. ICAO is a United Nations specialised agency, established by States in 1944 to manage the administration and governance of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention). It works with the Convention’s 193 Member States and industry groups to reach consensus on international civil aviation Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs), and policies in support of a safe, efficient, secure, economically sustainable and environmentally responsible civil aviation sector. These SARPs and policies are used by ICAO Member States to ensure that their local civil aviation operations and regulations conform to global norms, which in turn permits more than 100,000 daily flights in aviation’s global network to operate safely and reliably in every region of the world. Seventy five years on, the international civil aviation network carries over four billion passengers annually, where it continues coordinate assistance and capacity building for States in support of numerous aviation development objectives; Produces global plans to coordinate multilateral strategic progress for safety and air navigation; monitors and reports on numerous air transport sector performance metrics; and audits states’ civil aviation oversight capabilities in the areas of safety and security.
