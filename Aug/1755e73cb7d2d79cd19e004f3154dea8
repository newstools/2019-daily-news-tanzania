DODOMA City Council has announced plans to launch the second edition of mobile clinic initiative to promote safe motherhood and reproductive health skills amongst the youth. The revelation was made in Dodoma City by Dodoma District Commissioner (DC), Patrobas Katambi at the climax of the International Youth Day, recently saying: “Plans are underway for the city to rollout mobile clinic initiative that would help provide service to women, children and the elderly who are far from Health Centers.” He said the day nationally marked in the city was important in rolling out initiatives targeting the key population, who are ahead in government’s action plan. He said that the clinic would ensure that all community members including those who live in far places from District and Municipal Clinics have access to HIV and pregnancy tests as well as family planning resources. Mr Katambi noted that at the 41 Wards in Dodoma the mobile clinic service will serve them all, saying : “Although there has been improvement in the health care following the construction of the modern Hospital-Benjamin Mkapa U ltramodern Unit.” In Tanzania, for instance maternal mortality rate stands at over 500 women per every 100,000 live birth, where in Dodoma alone over 50 percent of pregnant women still give birth at home. This is a challenge to the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), three that calls for healthy lives and promoting wellbeing for all at all ages. Reached for a comment, UNFPA Youth and Development Program Manager, Dr Majaliwa Marwa, said : “The goal is also to end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births,” he said.
