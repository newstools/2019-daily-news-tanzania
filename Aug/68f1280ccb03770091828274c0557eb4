The TTB said this year’s SITE, to be held in Dar es Salaam, is expecting to attract some 400 local and international exhibitors. TTB’s Managing Director Ms Devotha Mdachi said apart from marketing the traditional northern, tourism agents and brokers will be exposed to the attractions in southern sphere. “The local and international tourism brokers and agents will be exposed to the southern highlands tourism attractions by visiting Ruaha, Udzungwa and Mikumi national parks,” Ms Mdachi told reporters yesterday. She said the agents also will be exposed to southern cultural tourism— including dances and traditional foods. SITE, a three-day expo, will take place in the third weekend of October at Mlimani City Shopping Mall, one of the largest in the country. Also, TTB will use the coming SITE to market beach tourism, comprising of mainland beaches covering a total length of about 800km extending from the border with Kenya in the north to Ruvuma River in the south and 430km around Unguja and 450km around Pemba Islands. The beaches are blessed with year round sunshine and a balmy climate of around 30 degrees centigrade. Ms Mdachi said they are aiming to use the Swahili Expo to connect local brokers and agents with the international ones while winning further Asian markets the likes of India, China, Japan, and Malaysia. Ms Mulk Akoo from Amimza coffee processing firm said they plan to market locally produced coffee to the international market using the Expo. “We are going to use the exhibition to popularise locally produced coffee,” Ms Akoo said.

The Expo will take the format of a travel and trade exhibition with a conference element focusing on topical tourism, sustainability, conservation and other market related issues.
