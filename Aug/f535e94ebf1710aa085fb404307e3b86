TANZANIA Insurance Regulatory Authority (TIRA) has embarked on enforcement of insurance regulations that require all decision makers in insurance firms to have insurance-related qualifications. Commissioner for Insurance Dr Mussa Juma told the ‘Daily News’ in Dar es Salaam over the weekend that the authority is currently conducting inspections to establish how insurance companies have been adhering to the regulations. “The regulations are clear and understandable… everybody in insurance sector knows but unfortunately, many have been taking the directives for granted. After the inspections, the authority will set a certain time-frame for all non-qualified persons to go to school. We will also convene the stakeholders’ meeting for emphasis,” he said. TIRA had planned to set at least five years for the unqualified to upgrade their qualifications, revealing that the regulations demand decision makers—mostly directors and managers—in the insurance sector to possess at least a first degree or Masters in insurance-related issues. The same applies to their subordinates who should have at least certificate level of education, Dr Juma elaborated. He stressed that highly qualified and skilled personnel in insurance sector are inevitable to help in determining what the market demands and come up with innovative new products to meet the market. “Livestock insurance for instance needs experts who are aware of the distribution of premiums in line with a certain group of livestock. Cattle have their own premiums, goats and birds as well. But, many companies have been messing-up due to lack of insurance-related training,” he said. Dr Juma said lack of qualified personnel in insurance sector leads to ineffective services to the public, discouraging people from insurance services, as a result. According to the commissioner, the time frame for acquisition of the requisite academic qualifications starts in this academic year.
