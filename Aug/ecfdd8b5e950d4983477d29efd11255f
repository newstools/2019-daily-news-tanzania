THE Julius Nyerere International Airport (JNIA) has assured the Uganda Airlines of ‘on time performance,’ with facilities available at the newly launched state-ofthe-art Terminal III. The ‘on time performance’ for an aircraft is a simple calculation indicating aircraft departure and arrival at airports. The JNIA assurance came when the Uganda Airlines yesterday introduced its direct route to Dar es Salaam from Entebe, Uganda. There was a colourful ceremony at the airport Terminal III after the Ugandan commercial flight landed. The aircraft was welcomed with water salute at the ground at around 10am. JNIA Director Paul Rwegasha thanked the Ugandan Airlines for choosing the airport as one of its destinations. “With facilities available at the Terminal III, the on time performance as well as safety and security are things we guarantee,’ he said. On her side, Uganda Airlines Commercial Director, Ms Jenifer Bamuturaki, said it marked a great milestone for the airline as it started commercial flights to Tanzania. “The introduction of the flight to Dar es Salaam gives travellers multiple choices... we are not coming as a competitor, but rather to supplement on existed airlines,” she said. She assured that the Uganda Airline will enable people move from one place to another at an affordable fares. She said the new route would also facilitate more movement of people within the East African Community (EAC). Commenting, Ugandan High Commissioner to Tanzania, Mr Richard Koboneno, asked the Uganda Airlines and the Air Tanzania Company Ltd (ATCL) to collaborate in serving travellers between the two countries.
