WEST Coast Shotokan Karate Association’s four-day workshop on the martial art and Grading started well yesterday at CCM Regional Hall in Mwanza. Running from yesterday August 1st to 4th, 2019, the Martial Arts training in Mwanza, will major on selfdefence, Kappap Krav Maga skills to its trainees. According to the Country Director of Kappap Krav Maga, Sensei Dadi Kassim, who is also the Chief Instructor, the training has drawn more than 50 participants from Mwanza-based clubs including some members of the local security forces. “The aim of this training is to transform karate from being a mere Martial Arts form into something which can create careers among the artists, because such skills without discipline can result into misuse,” said Sensei Kassim. Participants for the training come from all over the country, notably Shinyanga, Ushirombo, Karagwe, Mwanza and its districts. The seminar will also involve technical skills for judges, umpires and referees because the levels of these instructors are far from being satisfactory and still leave a lot to be desired. Regions that have active martial arts events are Arusha, Tanga, Singida, Mwanza, Kigoma, Mbeya, Iringa, Songea, Dodoma, Morogoro, Kilimanjaro, Dar es- salaam and Zanzibar. Sensei Kassim said that during the Mwanza sessions that at least five Karate instructors will be grilled and then tested to prove their various skills and positions in the martial arts sports. Other trainees are expected to sit for examinations at the end of the four-day sessions.
