THE German based firm, Mobisol Tanzania, has said sufficient and reliable energy is fundamental in driving up industrialisation as the country envisions becoming middle income economy in few years’ time. Speaking to journalists in the Coast region yesterday, Mobisol Tanzania Sales Manager, Coastal Zone, Wesley Muyenze said the use of off grid solar solution guarantees reliable energy for business growth. “The increasing solar adoption will open up new opportunities for small scale industries and promote growth of enterprises which are key to driving up economic growth,” he said. Driven by market demand for offgrid solutions beyond lighting, he said Mobisol as the key player in decentralised solar electrification designs, distributes and services large home and commercial solar systems, seamlessly integrated with proprietary software. He said there is growing awareness among Tanzanians in making use of solar energy for home use and for business and other economic activities leading to improved living standards. Currently, there are more than 100,000 solar home systems installed since when the company established its footprints in Tanzania and has as well managed to reach more than 500,000 people in the country and contributes to a reduction of more than 30,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually. Mobisol Tanzania has to date installed 10,710 KW which is equivalent to 10.71 MW and in essence is greater than the maximum power capacity produced at Nyumba ya Mungu hydro power station (8MW) in Mwanga Kilimanjaro or even Somanga thermal power station whose production capacity is 7.5MW. Mobisol enables rural families and businesses to power a wide range of compatible appliances, such as televisions, stereos and refrigerators, thereby improving their standard of living while earning incremental income by supporting new solar-powered businesses. Mobisol also has its operations in Kenya and Rwanda, while providing its software solution “Paygee” and hardware through a growing network of B2B partnerships in currently another nine countries worldwide.
