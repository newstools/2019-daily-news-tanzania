MINISTER for Energy Medard Kalemani has directed a contractor of Kinyerezi I Extension Project to accomplish it within one month in accordance with the agreement. The contractor, Mr Jacobsen Elektro, from Norway has abandoned the project on the grounds that he is bankrupt. The project, which is funded by the government of Tanzania by 100 per cent, is expected to be completed this month. “If you have already been paid why you didn’t deliver on time? We want you to complete the project not otherwise,” the minister stressed. He added: “I have been informed that the project has been abandoned for one month now. I want to see the work in progress immediately. If the contractor is bankrupt we are not concerned. We expect to produce 185MW after one month.” He instructed Tanesco Deputy Managing Director (Investment), Khalid James, to ensure the project was completed as planned and not otherwise. The minister also visited a transmission line which starts from Kinyerezi Power Station to supply power to the standard gauge line. The minister called on contractors of the transmission line to speed up and complete the project by December this year.
