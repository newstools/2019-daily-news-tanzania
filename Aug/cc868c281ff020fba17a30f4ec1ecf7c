AGRICULTURAL experts and researchers have warned against the misuse of agrochemicals. Key players in the agricultural production chain cautioned that if not used responsibly, pesticides, herbicides and fungicides could deal to a major blow to agricultural production. “Unfortunately, the majority of farmers apply pesticides in violation of recommendations, including unsafe storage facilities, ignoring risks and safety instructions,” said Mr Joseph Tuku, senior logistics and operations officer with Gatsby Africa yesterday. Mr Tuku, who was responding to reporters’ questions on the sidelines of a seminar on the proper use of agrochemicals, noted that small-scale farmers too did not use protective clothing, when applying pesticides and disposed of containers improperly. “This is a threat to the health of farmers and the agricultural sector, resulting in low crop yield and incomes,” he explained. The Gatsby Africa official further noted that the organization, whose aim was to accelerate inclusive and resilient economic growth in East Africa, was this year implementing the Cotton Sector Development Programme (CSDP), with the ultimate goal of piloting the concept of professionalisation of agro-chemical supply and spray service provision (SSP), in the Lake Zone. According to Mr Tuku, such an intervention seeks to improve supply and demand for safe and environmentally- responsible spray services, by ensuring a judicious and effective use of agrochemicals linked to competent village-based agro-dealers, who give solutions to farmers’ problems. The project targets 2,457 farmers, who cultivate a mixture of strategic crops like cotton, maize, chickpeas, green gram and vegetables on 8,584.5 acres. Gatsby Africa has continually been engaging Tropical Pesticides Research Institute (TPRI), the regulatory body of all the agrochemicals and business in Tanzania to develop specific training modules and a certification system to existing spray service providers.
