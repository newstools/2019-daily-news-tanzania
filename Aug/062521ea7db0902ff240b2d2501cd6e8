PARLIAMENTARY portfolio committees meet here today to review and discuss the Controller and Auditor General (CAG) reports as well as public capital investment reports ahead of the 16th parliamentary session on September 3. The committees are also scheduled to discuss three bills— The Written Laws (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No 4.) and (No 5.) of 2019 as well as the E-Government Bill of 2019. “Nine portfolio committees and the budget committee will analyse the institutional, ministerial and government reports on implementation of various activities in accordance with Article 7 (1), section 7 (2) (i) (ii) (iii) and (iv) Section 9 (a) of the Eighth Amendment of the Parliament standing rules,” the National Assembly Communication unit said in a statement here yesterday.
