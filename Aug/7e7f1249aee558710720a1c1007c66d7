MALINDI FC Assistant Coach Ahmed Sahel Machupa is optimistic his side will advance saying the away draw in their Confederation Cup match against Mogadishu City has put them on a better side. Speaking to the ‘Daily News’ here yesterday, Machupa said they will work hard in the return leg at Amaan Stadium to ensure they win by any margin. “Away draw is not bad to us since it makes our job easy in the return leg,” he said. Malindi, who were promoted last season, stamped a barren draw with Mogadishu City at Amaan Stadium, in the match hosted by latter. Mogadishu opted to play their home match in Zanzibar for security reasons as Somalia peace is still volatile. Machupa said Mogadishu City played very cautious game, something that made it difficult for Malindi to score. He promised to sharpen the striking force in order to convert more goals. He said he has carefully studied his opponents and saw a number of weaknesses. Also viewed his comments was Mogadishu City coach Mohammed Lamjed who admitted his team played with extra care to ensure they don’t concede goals and his plans worked well. He, however, admitted the match was tough at an away venue though they played it as hosts. He concluded saying a 1-0 win is what they want in their return leg. Mogadishu City Club (MCC) is a Somalia multi- Sports club present in the Capital City of Somalia. It was established in 1963 (56 years ago) and nicknamed as Municipio Club. It was a very rich club, created by the highly motivated young sports players composed of boys and girls playing all types of sports. Following the start of the civil war in the early 1990s, the stadium of Mogadishu Club was virtually reduced to shells.
