RIGHT from grassroots levels, Tanzania is no match to fellow East African states when it comes to sports. The country was beaten black and blue in athletics events at ongoing Federation of East African Secondary Schools Sports Association games climaxing here. Kenya was the overall winner in Athletics events of FEASSSA after reaping 18 gold medals, 11 silver medals and 10 bronze medals, totalling to 39 medals counting to 359 points. Uganda came second with 10 gold medals, 14 silver medals and 10 bronzes, totalling to 34 medals with 334 points. Tanzania mainland has managed to get just two gold medals, five silvers and 8 bronzes adding up to 15 medals and has remained home with 209 points. Rwanda fared even worse with just 2 medals and 29 points, while Zanzibar went back to the Isles empty handed. Athletics events that featured during FEASSSA games here include 10,000 meters; 5000 meters, 3000 meters; 1500 meters and 800 meters as well as 400 meters’ races; Long Jump, Triple Jump; High Jump, Javelin, Shot Put and Discus. Admitting defeat, Robert Kalyahe, who is the Tanzanian team coach in FEASSSA and member of technical committee of the National athletics association, said Kenya and Uganda have well-put systems that govern sports in schools, including huge budgets in the sector, that is why the two countries will always be ahead. “Tanzania simply picked players randomly from the previous Secondary School games in Mtwara, with little if any preparations and that is why we could not make it in the matches,” lamented Kalyahe, advising that it is high time the country forms its own sporting academies where students will be practicing continuously
