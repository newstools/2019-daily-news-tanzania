LOCAL small businesses and entrepreneurs need to develop their knowledge in preparing business plans so as to help them grow their capital, a University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM), expert has said. Speaking during the 19th International Conference on African Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development (ICAESB), Mr Peter Bagumhe from the University of Dar es Salaam said many local small traders and entrepreneurs do not have the knowledge to prepare a business plan to guide their business activities. “My advice to them, they can organise themselves into groups and prepare business plan that would help them to get low interest loans and raise capital for their business activities,” he said at the conference hosted by the University of Dar es Salaam Business School (UDBS). The two-day conference involved representatives from 10 countries including United Kingdom, South Africa, Sweden, Uganda, Kenya, the US, Nigeria, Lesotho, Botswana and the host Tanzania. This year’s conference involved with the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the UDBS, formerly the Faculty of Commerce and Management which was established in 1979. The UDSM’s Deputy V ice- Chancellor (Administration), Prof David Mfinanga officiated the conference as the guest of honor on behalf of the Vice- Chancellor, Prof William Anangisye. “The importance of SMEs growth in an increasingly globalising world has compelled the Business School to come up with this year’s conference,” said Prof Mfinanga. He said through the annual conference by UDBS it would help local entrepreneurs and small and medium traders to boost the entrepreneurship status of the country and increase the national income. In the conference, participants presented different research papers and shared practical experiences related sub-themes: SMEs and Industrialization, SMEs in Tourism, Oil and Gas and Mining sectors, Social Entrepreneurship, Human Resource Management in SMEs, Cross-cutting issues such as HIV /AIDS, Gender, Environment, Governance and SMEs Internationalization, to mention but a few.
