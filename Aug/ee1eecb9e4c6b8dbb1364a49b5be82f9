THE government has set aside 40bn/- this fiscal year for the construction of 25 new vocational training colleges under the Vocational Education Training Authority (VETA) in 25 districts. VETA Public Relations Officer Dora Tesha told the ‘Daily News on Saturday’ yesterday that the construction of additional centres would help reduce a shortage of training institutes amidst increasing applications from students seeking to acquire various skills. According to her, of late students seeking vocational training have been increasing, reaching over 800,000 a year, while VETA can only manage to enrol 200,000. "By the end of last fiscal year we had the construction of new centres in Simiyu, Njombe, Geita and Rukwa, whereas this fiscal year we have secured funds for the construction of other 25 centres in 25 districts," she said. If all goes well, VETA will increase the enrolment of students from the current annual 200,000 to 700,000 in 2023, thanks to the government’s budget allocation. VETA has participated in this year's Nanenane Exhibi- tion with a number of new innovations, including machines. The machines, according to local experts, who invented them, are a maize planting machine, a cashew nut hand sharing machine and a food dehydrator millet threshing machine designed to reduce post harvests losses. According to experts Ricky Sambo, the inventor of food dehydrator and Sussack Mbulu, the inventor of a cashew nut hand sharing machine, strategies are underway to embark on mass production so that many farmers can get them at affordable price. "A cashew nut hand sharing machine is sold at 400,000/- each, but I will produce more and supply to Lindi, Mtwara and Ruvuma to meet the growing demand by cashew nut farmers there," he said.
