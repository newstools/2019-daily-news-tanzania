MINISTER of State in the Vice- President’s Office responsible for Environment and Union Affairs George Boniface Simbachawene, has urged Tanzanians to talk about successes of the Union between Zanzibar and mainland instead of focusing only on challenges. “We have a lot of successes in our unique union; let us highlight them instead of voicing challenges. I am here to work with you towards a stronger union,” he said here in a meeting with directors operating under the office of the second vice president. Mr Simbachawene is on a familiarisation visit to Zanzibar following his recent appointment to the hold position, replacing Mr January Makamba. He said his office was open to them and any Tanzanian to share any views focused on strengthening the union and safeguarding the environment. During the short visit, the minister toured some entities, such as Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF) being successfully implemented by the union government. He commended the Zanzibar government for its good work, including reducing challenges in the Union from 15 recorded in 2006 down to five. “Soon we will overcome the challenges (dubbed ‘Kero za Muungano’). But we should understand that as long as we live together in a healthy Union, we cannot avoid challenges,” Mr Simbachawene said. His host, Mr Mohamed Aboud Mohamed - State Minister responsible for Union Affairs, operating under the Second Vice President’s Office, welcomed Mr Simbachawene and his delegation, promising close collaboration. “Congratulations for your appointment; we are ready to work with you. There are a lot of achievements in the Union that benefit people. TASAF is one for the success projects as it has really transformed the lives of people in villages,” Mr Mohamed said. He said the relations between Zanzibaris and people in the Mainland was historical and reflected in various areas, and that free movement also involving trade is something worth mentioning along with similarities even in lifestyle and behaviours.
