MINISTER for Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, Dr Harrison Mwakyembe, has praised the media in the country for exemplary coverage of the just ended 39th Southern African Development Community (SADC), Summit. He said media houses-- both private and public- manifested a sense of patriotism and high level of professional ethics, which demonstrated that they were all for the betterment of the nation. Speaking in Dodoma yesterday, Dr Mwakyembe said that being watchdogs, journalists in the country were obliged to report on issues, including making constructive criticism that would help the government fully deliver to wananchi. Tanzania hosted the 39th SADC summit on August 17 and 18 in Dar es Salaam whereby President John Magufuli took over as chairman of the 16-nation regional economic integration body. “Journalists in the country, apart from fully covering the meeting, also spent the best part of their time to promote the country’s investment opportunities in different sectors,” Minister Mwakyembe said. He noted that Dr Magufuli being at the helm of the regional body, Tanzanians and all citizens in the southern African countries had much hopes that a lot of achievements will be recorded, more specifically through elimination of unnecessary restrictions on business and investment related issues. Dr Mwakyembe further called upon Tanzanians to capitalize on the decision reached by the summit of endorsing Kiswahili as one of the official languages of the SADC. He advised Tanzanians to use that opportunity to advertise their goods as well as venture into writing various books in Kiswahili language.
