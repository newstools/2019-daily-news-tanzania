THE government is looking for alternative ways of procuring its vehicles straight from the manufacturing companies and dropping agents to avoid high and unpredictable costs. This was revealed by the Deputy Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Finance and Planning, Dr Khatibu Kazungu during his official visit at the Government Procurement Services Agency (GPSA) offices in Dar es Salaam yesterday. Visit aimed at discussing and identifying challenges and successes in implementation of the 2018/19 institution’s budget. “Procuring the government cars is costly because of using middlemen whose prices are exorbitant and often erratic...there is need to gostraight to the manufacturers and save taxpayers’ money that is being wasted,” he remarked. Dr Kazungu noted that the government is also looking into improving GPSA’s infrastructure especially in oil wells to have sufficient oil, which will increase efficiency in serving government vehicles. GPSA Chief Executive Officer Dr Geraldine Rasheli thanked Dr Kazungu for his visit and promised to work on the discussed issues to reduce lamentation in service provision and increase productivity for the nation’s benefit. Dr Kazungu is continuing with his official visits to other institutions under the ministry to identify challenges in the implementation of the 2018/19 budget and ways of solving them. The efforts of reducing the cost in procuring government vehicles started with the bulk procurement arrangement in 2016, where GPSA was able to save 1.3 bn/- between March and November 2016. The money was rescued af- ter the government bought 3 93 vehicles at 5 6.1bn/- instead of 5 8.1b/- in retail price or if each of the government institutions had ordered their own vehicles. The bulk purchasing scheme was able to rescue more funds and redirect them to other areas. GPSA also came with the Fuel Management Information System (FMIS) which was set to save fuel that was lost deliberately by dishonest government officials.
