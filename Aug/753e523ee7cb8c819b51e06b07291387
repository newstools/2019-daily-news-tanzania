KISUTU Resident Magistrateâ€™s Court in Dar es Salaam has sentenced seven immigration officers to a total of 66 years in jail or over 16m/- fine for, among other charges, assisting Chinese nationals to engage in occupation in Tanzania. Principal Resident Magistrate Huruma Shaidi imposed the sentence recently on Fredrick Kumalija, George Elikana, Bhoke Mwita, Fatuma Songoro, Kelvin Ponela, Robert Mkini and Revocatus Mugisha after convicting them of 27 charges on their own plea of guilty. Other charges under which the immigration officers were convicted includes leading organised crime, making false statements for the purposes of obtaining resident permits and furnishing false information for the purposes of procuring work permits. The counts also include attempt to obtain working permit by presenting false document and obtaining work permit. According to the charge sheet, Kumalija alone faced 25 counts. While Kumalija, Mwita, Songoro, Ponela, Mkini and Mugisha are charged jointly with one count of aiding and abetting a Chinese national, Kumalija and Elikana were jointly charged with one count of leading organised crime. In his judgment, the magistrate sentenced each accused to either pay a fine of 500,000/- or go to jail for two years on each count. Under the circumstances, Kumalija alone will have to go deeper in his pocket by paying a total fine of 13.5m/- to escape the jail term of 54 years. Elikana, Mwita, Songoro, Ponela, Mkini and Mugisha, according to the judgment, will pay only 500,000/- each, making a total of 3m/-as fine if they would not wish to serve the custodian sentence of two years since they are everyone facing one count, as per the charge sheet.
