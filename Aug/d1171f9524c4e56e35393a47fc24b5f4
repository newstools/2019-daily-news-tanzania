MEMBERS of the African Organisation for Standardisation (ARSO) met in Dar es Salaam on Tuesday to discuss and specify quality standards mark on clean water and sewage to be used by all African countries. The Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) Director General Dr Yusuf Ngenya said the meeting brought together experts on standards from 31 ARSO members. Dr Ngenya said ARSO members were in the process of making one quality standards mark to be used for clean water and wastewaters. “Every country has its own quality standard but the meeting has brought together stakeholders who are members of ARSO to discuss on how to get one quality standard to be used for clean water and wastewaters,” he said. He said there is huge advantage of using one quality standard for local business people with goods bearing TBS quality mark that help them to avoid unnecessary disturbances when trading with other African countries. “In order to have smooth business flow and remove various impediments, there is need for specifying quality standards for clean water to be used by all countries,” he said. On his part the Chief Executive Officer for the African Ministers’ Council on Water (AMCOW) Dr Canisius Kanangire said there is need to have one quality standards mark for all African countries. He said having one quality standards mark will help to identify clean water and ensure that they meet the required standards, an important initiative in fighting waterborne diseases. “There is need to have clean water that meets quality standards in order to avoid waterborne diseases and deaths,” he added. An official with ARSO, Philip Anyango said human life is important than anything else and thus harmonizing standards for clean water was of paramount importance.
