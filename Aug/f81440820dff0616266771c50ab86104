THE government has said that emergency and rescue vehicles procured recently will be used during the 39th Southern African Development Community (SADC), summit before being distributed to various rescue centres. Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children Deputy Minister, Dr Faustine Ndungulile revealed this on Wednesday when he toured Toyota offices in Dar es Salaam. Dr Ndungulile said that the vehicles have come at the right time as the country is scheduled to host the 39th SADC summit mid this month. He said the emergency service vehicles and two rescue buses will be used for providing health services to delegates of the summit. “These vehicles will be used during the SADC meeting, and thereafter they will be distributed to rescue centres located away from hospitals which will be used to transport accident victims,” he said. He said that apart from the twelve vehicles, there are two buses with all important services with capacity of serving twenty people at a time. Dr Ndungulile, however, said that the government was well positioned to use air transport for individuals in need of emergency services of moving them from one point to another especially to Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH). The post-crash care will enable people injured in road accidents and patients in need of emergency services to be attended at the scene before being referred to health facilities, saving lives that could have been lost due to service delays. “The government has put this system in place to improve post crash-care for victims of road crash...so that they can receive services within 24 hours set for attending casualties,” Dr Ndungulile said. He noted that fire and rescue vehicles which have been ordered had modern equipment which can also be used to rescue people who have been trapped in vehicles which have been involved in accidents.
