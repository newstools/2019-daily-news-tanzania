THE death toll from the fuel tanker blast that occurred in Morogoro Region last Saturday has risen to 82, according to a Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) official. The hospital’s spokesperson, Mr Aminiel Aligaesha, said yesterday that six out of 38 victims admitted to the national health facility died on Tuesday night. He said in Dar es Salaam that 32 patients were nursing wounds at the hospital, 17 of whom were in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). “We are trying our best, applying the maximum level of expertise we have to save the lives of the patients,” he said. The tragic incident occurred after a fuel tanker overturned with some people in the area flocking to syphon petrol. According to regional authorities, the explosion was triggered when a man tried to retrieve the truck’s battery, triggering sparks that ignited the fuel, leaving more than 60 people dead on the spot. On Sunday, Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa represented President John Magufuli in the mass burial held at Kola Hill cemetery in Morogoro municipality.
