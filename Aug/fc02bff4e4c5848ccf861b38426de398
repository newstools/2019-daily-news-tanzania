IN support of on-going efforts to ensure that freq uent shortage of fuel becomes an issue of the past, the Zanzibar government has purchased a 3 6bn/-oil tanker from China. The 86.2 metresong vessel was received with joy at Malindi main seaport. According to a press state- ment from Isles State House, President Ali Mohamed Shein was prompted to get out of his office and stand at the veranda just to see the brand new vessel as it entered Zanzibar yesterday at around 11am, after about 28 days journey from Shanghai China where it was built. “The president was vis- ibly happy as he witnessed the grand entrance of the oil tanker named MT Ukombozi II with a capacity of carrying/store 3 ,5 00 ton of oil. Thanks to the Dutch/Netherlands DAMEN TANKER SHIP Company for building the vessel,” the statement reads. Dr Shein had previously promised to buy the oil tanker to improve fuel transportation to Zanzibar which has in the recent past been hit by freq uent fuel shortage, attributed to poor supply and transportation, poor planning and increasing oil de- mand in the tourist Islands. The Permanent Secretary (PS), in the Ministry of Infra- structure, Communication, and Transport, Mr Mustapha Aboud Jumbe, said MT Ukombozi vessel project started in 2017, followed by manufacturing in July last year until end of the work in April this year. “Let us celebrate the achievement which is part of implementation of the ruling party-Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), 2015 /2020 election manifesto. President Shein deserves praise for his efforts in seeing that Zanzibar moves forward in all sectors,” Jumbe said, adding that the official inauguration of the new oil tanker is underway with Dr Shein expected to grace the event. Dr Shein also made it possible for the purchase of a pas- senger/cargo vessel named MV Mapinduzi II in 2015 , with a capacity of carrying 1200 pas- sengers and 200 tons of cargo. Daewoo International of South Korea built the ship at a cost of USD3 0.4 million (69.6bn/-)
