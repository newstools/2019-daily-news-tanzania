A part of the slave caravan route inside the Highland Estate Ubena is the main battlefield of the engine war to be staged next month as Oryx Rally of Tanzania. The two-day Oryx Rally, is the Tanzanian round of African Rally Championship (ARC), that usually draws top drivers and navigators from all over the continent. The event’s director Satinder Birdi said preparation has been going on steadily ahead of the wheeling showdown on September 13th , 14th and 15th. According to Birdi, Oryx Energies of Tanzania is the title sponsor while Southern Sun Hotel, Highland Estate Ubena and Knight Support have joined as associate sponsors. Also serving as the sixth round of the continental class rally, Oryx Rally of Tanzania, pits local drivers against the continental class drivers. The crews coming in pairs of drivers and navigators will represent five countries in the rally, according to the event’s Director, Satinder Birdi. With safety taking the leading role, Birdi said the rally will stage most of its actions at Highland Estate Ubena and Lugoba, about 120 kilometres west of the commercial capital, Dar es Salaam. “ The dusty roads around the areas are safe for both drivers and spectators due to low traffic,” added Birdi. Safety of crews and spectators was the most serious agenda in motorsports as both the event’s director, Birdi and the President of the motorsports governing body (AAT), Nizar Jivani have issued warning to the drivers and spectators against violating safety measures in all sections of the two-day rally. “ We have been staging safe rallies for over 16 years since becoming affiliated members of the world motorsports governing body (FIA)”. The foreign crews come from Kenya, Uganda, Zambia, Rwanda and Scotland. Kenyan crews; Manvir Baryan and his Scottish navigator, Drew Sturrock will be the first off ramp in ultramodern car Scoda Fabia.
