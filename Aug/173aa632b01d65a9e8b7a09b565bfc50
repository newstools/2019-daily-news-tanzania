THE Government Chemist Laboratory Authority (GCLA) seeks more participatory means to involve the private sector in curbing misuse of chemicals. GCLA yesterday met with stakeholders in the city, including importers of chemicals, transporters and others, and took them through legal requirements as a way of creating public awareness and make them ambassadors in the fight against the misuse of chemicals. Acting Director for Forensic Science and DNA at GCLA David Elias said there was roaring concern over the misuse of chemicals and production of harmful substances such as illegal drugs in the country. Mr Elias was speaking on behalf of GCLA during the opening of the workshop on the control and misuse of chemicals. It was said that some transporters diverged chemical consignments to unintended destinations for producing illegal drugs. He said the government had been using various means to solve the problem, including coming up with stringent laws. He noted that it was important for stakeholders to understand the laws and for law enforcers to implement them. “I urge you (stakeholders) to be open and provide recommendations on how best to cooperate with the authority to realise the government’s goal to address loopholes leading to misuse of chemicals,” he appealed. For her part, Commissioner for Inspections and Forensic Sciences from the Drugs Control and Enforcement Authority (DCEA) Bertha Mamuya said they believed the participation of stakeholders would improve efficiency to control the misuse of chemicals and consequently fight against illegal drugs. She said deliberations during the workshop would contribute to more voluntary collaboration between stakeholders and regulatory bodies in fighting against illegal drugs. Other government regulatory agencies that attended the workshop included Tanzania Medicines and Medical Devices Authority (TMMD) and Medical Stores Department (MSD).
