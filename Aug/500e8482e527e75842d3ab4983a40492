I am also giving seven days to Alliance Ginneries to pay a 1.1bn/-debt to Amcos,” he noted. The minister also directed the remaining 4,978,580kg worth 5.9bn/- to be sold in 14 days. Speaking at a joint meeting between the cotton board, cotton buyers and the Meatu District Commissioner (DC), Dr Joseph Chilongani, said cotton that had been collected through Amcos in the area was 13,500,000kg worth 16.2bn/- Mr Mpina, who also Kisesa MP, said through analysis cotton transported from warehouses was 8,549,930kg worth 10.2bn/- of which 2,184,883kg worth 2.6bn/-were transported to manufacturers, but the farmers had not been paid.
