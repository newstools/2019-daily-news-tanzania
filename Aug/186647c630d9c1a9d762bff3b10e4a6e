AN emergency team from the Benjamin Mkapa Hospital (BMH) has been commended for prompt response and participating actively in the provision of healthcare to survivors of the oil tanker explosion in Morogoro Region last weekend. At least 71 people died and 59 others were seriously burnt after the oil tanker overturned and fire erupted after petrol spilt over near Morogoro Regional Bus Terminal (Msamvu). The petrol spillage was alleged to have been caused by people, who had tampered with outlet valves so that they could easily draw the fuel spilling over from the tanker. President John Magufuli announced three days of mourning in which the country flew flags at half-mast. Yesterday, BMH Executive Director, Dr Alphonce Chandika, hailed the BMH emergency team for prompt response to travel from Dodoma to join other medical personnel and offer medical treatment to the survivors of oil tanker explosion. “I wish to commend our emergency team for prompt response to a fire accident and participating fully in the provision of medical treatment to the survivors of the oil tanker explosion in Morogoro Region,” said the hospital’s boss during a medical education programme. The head of BMH Emergency Department, Dr George Dilunga, noted that the provision of medical treatment to the survivors of the oil tanker explosion gave the BMH emergency team a great experience. “We will use challenges experienced during the provision of medical treatment to the survivors as a lesson for our team,” he said.
