NATIONAL Bank of Commerce (NBC) has pledged to finance and offer risk management solutions in funding of major projects in the country. Speaking at a special stakeholders forum held last week in the capital, Dodoma, to discuss Financing Options and Risk Management Solutions, NBC’s Director of Treasury and Financial Markets, Peter Nalitolela, said the lender was committed to partnering with the government in making sure that country gets the best valuefor- money in financing of major investment projects. At the meeting that brought together key officials from the Ministry of Finance and Planning, B ank of Tanzania (BoT), the Attorney General’s Office, TANESCO and Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC), Mr Nalitolela pledged to support various government initiatives. The forum discussed how the government could optimally raise funds for its major projects whilst managing the financial risks that may arise from funding other development activities in the country. The government is undertaking major construction projects namely Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) and Rufiji hydroelectric project. “Our role is to look at our capabilities in different areas including lending, but also to help the government manage potential losses— (such as loan) interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices,” Mr Nalitolela said. NBC is the oldest serving bank in the country with over five decades of experience and offers a range of retail, business, corporate and investment banking and wealth management products and services.
