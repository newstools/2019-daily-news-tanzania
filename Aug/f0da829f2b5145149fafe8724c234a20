AS Tanzania Breweries liquidity crawled back into hiding under the new trading rules, equity turnover on the market significantly went down while CRDB re-emerged as the top mover and the domestic market maintained value similar to the previous week. Tanzania Share Index (TSI), remained adamant at 3,291.83 points similar to the previous week while the domestic market capitalization remained at 9.065tri/- (3.94 billion US dollars). On the other hand, the total market capitalization went down by 0.23 per cent to close the week at 19.1tri/- (8.31billion US dollars). As a result the All Share Index (DSEI), fell by similar proportions equivalent to 4.49 points to close the week at 1,938.94 points. The drop in the total market capitalization resulted from prices dropping in four out of the seven cross listed counters but the deceleration was weakened by an increase in price of one heavyweight namely Kenya Commercial Bank which carries a 13.8 per cent weight of the total capitalisation of DSE. KCB rose by 1.14 per cent while Acacia Plc, East African Breweries, Kenya Airways and National Media Group dropped by 0.74 per cent, 0.22 per cent, 7.69 per cent and 9.09 per cent respectively. Total equity turnover dropped by 95 per cent to record a total of 351.69m/-(0.153 million US dollars), compared to the previous week which reported a turnover of 7.5bn/- (3.26 million US dollars). Total shares moved were 3.039 million shares up 78 per cent from previous week’s 1.7 million shares. CRDB Bank regained the top mover spot after commanding 85.2 per cent of the total equity turnover moved during the week. CRDB realized a turnover of 299.73m/- (0.13 million US dollars) from 3 million shares traded at prices between 100/-and 110/-. TBL moved 188 shares only during the week at a price of 10,900/-mostly due to new trading rules which limit the price of TBL at a lower end of 10,900/-. Local investors dominated the buying side of the market during the week, accounting for 99 per cent of investments, different from the previous week when foreigners were top investors. The selling side was however almost equally distributed with locals emerging on top, accounting for 52 per cent of total divestments from the market. The dominance movement of investments into the market between local and foreign investors is almost parallel to the dominance movement between TBL and CRDB. Local investors are highly interested with CRDB due to the lower price and recent growth prospects shown by the bank. Foreign investors are mostly interested in TBL due to the company’s stability and constant dividend disbursement. Therefore, most trading sessions with CRDB as top mover are likely to be dominated by local investors.
