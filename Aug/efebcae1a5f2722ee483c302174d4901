WOMEN anxious about the safety of their money to the extent of thinking of putting it deep under the brassier, should now have a second thought following a study which showed the popular trend as one of the leading causes of breast cancer. Speaking on the study which she conducted in Mikese area, Morogoro region, Ms Faraja Ng’ida from the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical University College (KCMUCO), said the study sought to describe knowledge and practices on breast cancer and associated challenges among women in Tanzania. “The study, which involved 130 participants, revealed several causes, including putting money under the brassier. Ms Ng’ida noted that of the 130 women interviewed during the study, all of them had already heard of breast cancer before and that 71.5 per cent knew the effects of the disease. “The study results also showed that 37.7 per cent knew about the signs and symptoms of breast cancer, with 73.8 per cent having never heard of breast selfexamination (BSE) as an early detection method of breast cancer. “Little is known about knowledge and practices on Breast Cancer in Tanzania hence this study which is aimed at describing knowledge and practices on breast cancer and the associated challenges among women in Tanzania,” she said. According to Ng’ida, lack of knowledge on early signs and symptoms was stated during the study as the highest challenge for Breast Cancer screening faced by majority of the participants. She said 83.1 per cent of the participants pointed out media especially Television and Radio programmes as their source of information about the disease. “Most of the women have heard of breast cancer but they lack adequate knowledge on the risk factors, causes, signs and symptoms as well as effects. The majority of women do not practice BSE due to lack of knowledge hence efforts to improve women’s knowledge on the disease is inevitable in developing countries like Tanzania,” she noted.
