TANZANIA Bureau of Standards (TBS), has appealed to small scale entrepreneurs (SMEs), in Lake Zone to acquire quality standard mark as a necessity in accessing the regional and global markets. The TBS Communication Officer, Neema Mtemvu made the plea to SMEs who attended a weeklong Kagera Business and Investment Forum that concluded over the weekend. “TBS recognises the SMEs contribution in driving up industrialisation agenda vital in boosting economic growth,” she said. Ms Mtemvu added that TBS has continually providing awareness to SMSs to make sure their goods meet the required  quality standards in order to penetrate wider markets. Acquiring q uality standard mark for SMEs is free because the government is paying all the cost as an incentive to promote small scale businesses to grow and contribute to economic growth. One of the req uirements for SMEs to get qauality standard mark is to have an introduction letter from the Small Industries Development Organisation (SIDO). Ms Mtemvu added that by acquiring q uality standard mark, an entrepreneur is assured of accessing the EAC and SADC markets that may impact on the increased sales revenue. “The TBS initiative is aimed at empowering SMEs to compete in the regional and global markets,” she noted. The weeklong on business and investment forum was an opportunity for TBS to explain to SMEs various obligations and in particular those recently transferred to the standard watchdog from the Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority (TFDA).
