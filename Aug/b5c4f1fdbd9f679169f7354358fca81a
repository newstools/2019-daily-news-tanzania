ASSISTANT Lecturer with National Institute of Transport (NIT) Samson Mahimbo yesterday appeared before the Kisutu Resident Magistrateâ€™s Court in Dar es Salaam charged with corruption and economic offence of sexual extortion from a student. The 68-year-old resident of Makongo Juu area in Kinondoni District is charged under the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Act and the Economic and Organised Crime Control Act. He denied the charge before Principal Resident Magistrate Huruma Shaidi. He was granted bail on condition of securing one surety with an identity card, who signed a bond of 4 m/-. The case was adjourned to September 17, 2 0 19 for the preliminary hearing. The prosecution informed the court that investigations into the matter have been completed. Prosecuting, an Officer with the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau ( PCCB) Vera Ndeoya, told the court that the accused person committed the offence on January 12, 2 0 17 at Camp David Guest House in Mlalakuwa areas at Mwenge in Kinondoni District. The court heard that being an employee with NIT as Lecturer of Semester One of Academic Year 2 0 15/2 0 16, in the exercise of his authority as Assistant Lecturer and Invigilator of Road Transport Management Subject, Mahimbo used the position to demand sexual favour from Victoria Faustine. It is alleged that Victoria was a student studying the said subject. According to the prosecution, the accused demanded sex as a condition that he would assist her to pass Supplementary Examinations in the forementioned subject held on January 5, 2017 . The arraignment of the lecturer comes amid claims that sexual assault at higher learning institutions in the country was becoming pervasive. Even though the distasteful trend has been in existence for years, its subliminal nature, owing to unreported cases, has enabled it to strive.
