DEPUTY Minister for Agriculture, Omary Mgumba, urges farmers to join National Social Security Fund (NSSF) because they are the main stakeholders in the informal sector. He said following the amendment of the Social Security Act of 2018, NSSF is providing social security services to workers from the private sector and informal including farmers, so they must use the opportunity to register with the Fund. Mr Mgumba said this at the weekend, during the Nanenane exhibition, taking place at the Nyakabindi stadium, Bariadi district in Simiyu region. “If you talk about the private and informal sector, the vast majority of its stakeholders are farmers of this country and especially small-scale farmers” he said. He said farmers who will join NSSF will benefit from a variety of services including old age pension, maternity benefits and health insurance and loans. Mr Mgumba, who is also a Member of Parliament for Morogoro South-East constituency, said farmers are now secured by joining NSSF. With the existence of NSSF’s he is confident that agriculture will be sustainable because small-scale farmers who will join the fund will receive loans that will help them to develop their agricultural activities such as buying seeds and inputs. During the exhibition, the Busega District Commissioner, Tano Mwera, called on the people from his district and the Mara, Mwanza, Shinyanga, Simiyu regions, especially those in the private and informal sector, to join the NSSF. Mr Tano said NSSF has now introduced the National Informal Sector Scheme, so he urges members from those sectors to join the fund so that they could benefit from various benefits. He said there are many benefits to someone registered in social security, that he will be sure of his present and future life.
