POLICE in Nkasi District in Rukwa Region have arrested ten people for allegedly impregnating schoolgirls, as a manhunt for four other suspects is ongoing. This was revealed at a media briefing session last Friday by the Nkasi District Commissioner, Mr Said Mtanda, at Namanyere township, on the sidelines of the International Women’s Day Celebrations. “All teenage schoolgirls in the district undergo pregnancy tests before holidays or shortly thereafter. Before Christmas holidays last year, three were found pregnant while 13 were found to be pregnant after being tested last January. Six of them were in primary schools and the rest were in secondary schools,” the DC explained. While addressing a public rally to mark the International Women’s Day held at Sabasaba Ground, Mr Mtanda was furious with parents and guardians who conspired to marry off schoolgirls, warning that stern measures would be taken against them, including prosecution. He appealed to wananchi to take a holistic approach in curbing child marriages and pregnancies, in order to contain the high rate of school dropouts. “The people here must collectively fight against outdated laws, customs and practices that conspire to keep women in the backyard and trample on many of their constitutionally guaranteed rights,” he added. Rukwa is one of the regions with the highest school dropout rates for girls due to teenage pregnancies, and there are no signs of the situation improving. At least 517 girl students dropped out of school from 2015 to 2018 .
