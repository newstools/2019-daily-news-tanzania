IN a bid to improve health services and curb Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in the country, the Aga Khan Hospital is looking forward to launch its 192bn/- building soon. The launching of the modern building is expected to provide relief to wananchi who suffer from non-communicable diseases. According to information released yesterday, Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa is expected to be the guest of honour during the launch, which is scheduled for Saturday, this week. Aga Khan Hospital is looking forward to using sophisticated equipment and technology in kidney and liver transplant, heart surgery and cancer treatment. Aga Khan Health Service Tanzania Medical Director, Dr Ahmed Jusabani, said the expansion of the hospital aims at among other things, promoting ‘Reverse Medical Tourism’ in the country, which minimises the number of Tanzanians who seek treatment abroad, mostly to India, South Africa and Europe. “With the increasing population of Tanzanians exiting the country to seek medical treatment abroad and the huge impact on the nation’s economy, it has become a matter of urgency to revamp the health sector to edge the ugly trend since 2013/14. The concept of Medical Tourism has served to undermine confidence in our healthcare system as most providers in countries mentioned, portray foreign doctors and medical facilities as vastly superior to those within Tanzania,” he said. According to him, the hospital’s models of care will double its reach by providing quality healthcare to over one million Tanzanians annually. The institution catered for 287 international patients mainly from Malawi, Zambia and the Comoro Islands in 2017.
