POLICE in Coast Region arrested 24 illegal immigrants of Ethiopian origin who were hiding in a bush in Zinga village along the Bagamoyo-Dar es salaam highway last Saturday. Regional Police Commander ACP Wankyo Nyigesa said here that, police officers rushed to the area immediately after being tipped off by some community members. “After reaching the area, the police established that they were Ethiopians, were illegal immigrants, and were very weak,” he said. After thorough interrogation, it was established that the Ethiopians were being taken care of by people who had promised to find transport for them to travel to South Africa, where they had been promised jobs. RPC Nyigesa explained that the Ethiopians had accessed the country through illegal ports in Bagamoyo District. “We will beef up patrols along the Indian Ocean coastline, especially in Bagamoyo area, despite the fact that the coastal line is very long and is dotted with more than 30 entry points which are used by illegal immigrants,” he further explained. The RPC said the police would continue to educate members of the public on the importance of working closely with law enforcers by identifying illegal immigrants and the steps they should take when they come across them.
