ONE person was killed instantly after he was struck by lightning in Ngara District in Kagera Region on Tuesday. Kagera Regional Police Commander (RPC) Revocatus Malimi named the man as Mr Silvan Ibrahim (29) from Mukaliza Village, Mabawe Ward. He said the incident occurred on Tuesday at about 3.30pm, when he was collecting water during the rain, which started at 2.30pm until 4pm. At least 14 people were killed in Kagera Region between 2010 to August 15, last year, after they were struck by lightning. On January 5, last year, lightning struck near Kimuli Secondary School in Kyerwa District, killing two students and injuring at least eight others. Again, on August 15, last year, two people from the same family died on the spot after they were struck by lightning in Karagwe District. The RPC named those killed on that day as Ms Coretha Protase (30) and Mr Onesmo Nestory (14), both villagers of Kanoni in Karagwe District. Three other villagers sustained minor injuries and were treated at Kanoni Health Centre and discharged. On June 9, 2012 six people from the same family died on the spot, when their house was struck by lightning at Kihinga Village in Kaisho/Murongo Division, Kyerwa District. Most Kagera residents believe lightning never strikes the same place twice. Yet, lightning may strike multiple times in the same place. So, it is always advised to take safety precautions rather than relying on myths.
