PARENTS of children with Down Syndrome (DS) have appealed to the government to create a conducive environment that would enable them to fully benefit from education, health and other social issues unlike now whereby they feel marginalised. The call was made in Dar es Salaam recently at an event to commemorate the World Down Syndrome Day organised by Pearl of People with Down Syndrome Foundation (PPDSF). “The government should put efforts to eradicate stigmatisation to children with DS, for currently people regard our children to be mentally retarded, the children need special schools to access education than it is the case now, as some few available special schools are far from their residences while private schools are expensive,” said Fatuma Omari, a mother of DS nine year old son Ahmed Hussein. Another parent, Ms Virginia Tambwe, called on doctors to break silence during the time of birth and tell parents the truth if their children are born with chromosome disorder which causes DS. She said after realising that, medics should counsel and give them basic training on how to adapt and care for their infants. For her side, PPDSF board member Ms Jeanne Ndyetabula requested the government to conduct a research throughout the country to get not only statistics for people with DS, young and old, but also to assess their socio-economic needs. The DS is a congenital disorder arising from a chromosome defect, causing intellectual impairment and physical abnormalities, including short stature and a broad facial profile.
