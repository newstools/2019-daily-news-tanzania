TWO Dar es Salaam residents appeared before the Kisutu Resident Magistrateâ€™s Court in the city on Tuesday, facing two counts of unlawful possession of elephant tusks, which are government trophies, valued at over 1bn/-and money laundering. They are Abdallah Hamis, alias Matimbwa, alias Taliban, and Adam Kawambwa. The two were not allowed to enter plea to the charges before Senior Resident Magistrate Augustine Rwizile because such counts fall under the Economic and Organised Crime Control Act. The magistrate ordered the duo to go to remand because the offence of money laundering they are facing is not bailable. The case was adjourned to March 25, 2019 for mention. Investigations into the matter, according to the prosecutions, have not been completed. State Attorney Candid Nasua, for the prosecution, told the court that the accused persons committed the offences on February 11, 2019 at Chanika kwa Zoo area within Temeke District in Dar es Salaam. The court heard that on the material day, the accused were found in possession of 47 pieces of elephant tusks, which are government trophies, valued at 465,000 US dollars, which is equivalent to 1,081,357,500/-, the property of the government without a permit from the Director of Wildlife Division. On the money laundering count, the prosecution alleged that on the same day and place in the city, the two accused persons acquired the 47 pieces of elephant tusks, valued at 1.08bn/- while they knew at the time of receipt such government trophies were proceeds of a predicate offence of poaching.
