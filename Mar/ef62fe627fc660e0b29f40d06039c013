THE Tanzania Basketball Federation (TBF) will start honouring former and active basketball players by giving them annual awards at the end of the year. Dubbed Basketball Hall of Fame Awards, the beneficiaries will be acknowledged for their wonderful job in facilitating the growth of the sport in the country. Breaking the news recently in Dar es Salaam was the federation’s President Phares Magesa, who revealed that initially, they planned to hold the event early this year but due to some challenges, they have shifted it to the end of the year. “We want to make this event big in the country by recognising remarkable works done by different people to uplift basketball in the country,” Magesa said. The TBF boss added that so far, about two Television stations have shown interest to broadcast live the event and he called upon more sponsors to come forward to seize the opportunity. In the same token, Magesa urged regions which are yet to start the Regional Basketball League (RBL) to begin now in order to move abreast with the federation’s timetable. “One major challenge we face in this sport is lack of sponsors. In many regions where RBL is played, there are no sponsors something which makes the competition lack seriousness and produce competitive players,” he said. He also disclosed that in June this year, the national junior and senior basketball teams will be playing in international competitions as such they need sponsors to enable the teams to do well in the approaching games
