THE current top goal scorer in the unfolding Mainland Premier League Salum Ayee said he is not worried for being excluded in the national football team squad readying to host Uganda. Taifa Stars face Uganda on March 24th at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam in a must win tie for the country’s side as the race towards this year’s Africa Cup of the Nation (AFCON) finals to be staged in Egypt intensifies. Ayee who plays for Shinyanga based Mwadui FC has since scored 15 goals to his name, three goals clear against his closest golden boot pursuers Heritier Makambo (Young Africans) and Meddie Kagere (Simba) who have netted 12 goals each. Speaking recently after helping his side to come from behind to demolish Mbeya City 3-1, Ayee said he hopes that when the right time come, he will be called to make his debut in the national football team. “ To be selected to play in the national team, there are certain criterias that coaches look for in a player and I think I have not yet fulfilled them,” Ayee said. He further said playing in the national football team is his ambition and will seize the opportunity with both hands when it arrives. Additionally, the top scorer lauded massive support he gets from his colleagues which necessitate him to hit behind the net in most league matches. “ On my own, I can not manage to score goals but the good teamwork I enjoy from teammates is the only weapon that make me lethal in front of the goal,” he said. Mwadui are placed ninth on the table with 36 points after 30 matches, hence safe from relegation zone.
