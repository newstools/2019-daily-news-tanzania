DEPUTY Minister for Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development, Dr Angelina Mabula, has been annoyed by development officers’ lack of seriousness in land tax collection. Accordingly, she challenged them to work hard and ensure land tax was collected and deposited in bank. She expressed her annoyance yesterday morning, while receiving a report at the Kagera Regional Commissioner’s Office. She said during the 2018/19 financial year, Bukoba District Council was tasked to collect 200m/- land tax, but to date it had only collected 29.06m/- (equivalent to 14 per cent). Bukoba Municipal Council, on the other hand, was tasked to collect 700m/-, but it only collected 278.5m/- (equivalent to 40 per cent of the target). Other councils with collection in brackets include Muleba (24 per cent), Kyerwa (nil) and Karagwe (74 per cent). Dr Mabula was also annoyed by a slow pace in the implementation of the regularisation of settlements and putting in place a workable land system. “Out of the 596 surveyed plots in Bukoba Municipal Council, only 458 of the plots have been issued with land title certificates, while their over 3bn/- uncollected tax,” she said, warning that disciplinary measures would be taken against ministry officials failing to deliver. For that reason, she directed the immediate removal of Bukoba District Council Acting Head of Department (Lands) John Mwingila for underperformance. She also directed the Zonal Lands Commissioner to issue a written warning to the acting Lands Development Officer for Bukoba Municipal Council and Bukoba DC Michael Paul. Dr Mabula later toured Kashai Ward and issued 101 land titles. While there she disclosed that out of the 11,330 surveyed plots, only 4,115 land titles had title deeds, thus advising villagers to visit zonal offices in Mwanza City to collect them.
