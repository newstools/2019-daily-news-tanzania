KAGERA residents have been warned against the practice of hiding illegal immigrants, which is taking root in the region and has become a chronic in other regions. Kagera Regional Immigration Officer (RIO), Pendo Buteng’e appealed for cooperation to expose and report illegal immigrants to the relevant authorities for action. “Investors are welcome, but people should avoid hiding illegal immigrants because it is a criminal offence. A person convicted of the offence risks being imprisoned up to 20 years or paying a fine of 20m/- or both. The house or vehicle used in such a criminal transaction will also be confiscated by the government,” he warned. He noted that the regional immigration office in Kagera Region had embarked on a crackdown on foreigners without residence or work permits. “The department will also take measures against officials issuing foreigners with fake documents.” He urged border villagers receiving visitors from neighbouring countries to contact nearest Immigration offices to get guidelines on how to access valid travel documents.
