TANZANIA is the only East African Community member state that has a billionaire in US dollar term, according to Knight Frank’s the Wealth Report 2019. The report further showed the East Africa second largest economy will have two billionaires coming 2023 staying in Tanzania while Uganda and Kenya will have none. Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan were not covered in the report. The 13th edition wealth report showed where millionaires and billionaires live with a simple objective– to explain how “private wealth is shaping property markets globally”. Liam Bailey, Knight Frank’s Global Head of Research said in order to achieve a more rounded picture, they also take an in-depth look at the things that interest and influence millionaires and billionaires from art to private jets, super yachts and classic cars. “As wealth increases, 2019 will see governments settle into two camps: the first will try to attract more of it; the second will seek to push it away,” Mr Bailey said. The report showed that the global wealthy population was forecast to rise by 22 per cent over the next five years, meaning an extra 43,000 people will be worth more than 30 million US dollars—excluding their primary residence—by 2023. On millionaire front, with over 1.0 million US dollars, Kenya leads the bloc with an increase of 13 per cent to 9,482 individuals in 2018 from 8,400 in 2013. Kenya, according to the report projection, will have an increase of 22 per cent to 11,584 millionaires in 2023. According to the report, those millionaires are high-net-worth individual – someone with a net worth of over 1.0 million US dollars excluding their primary residence. Tanzania in that vein is the second country in the bloc that has many millionaires staying in the country. In 2018 they were 6,429 millionaires on the land compared to 5,700 in 2013, which is an increase of 13 per cent. By 2023, Tanzania’s millionaires projected to increase by 18 per cent to 7,616 individuals. Uganda at the end of last year had 1,639 millionaires staying in Uganda which was an increase of 9.0 per cent from 1,500 of 2013. Kampala, the report showed, will produce 1,904 millionaires by 2023 and increase of 16 per cent. Overall Africa had 177,265 individuals last year with net worth of over 1.0 million US dollars and will increase to 208,713 individuals in 2023. Nairobi also leads on a number of millionaires whose net worth is over 30 million US dollars in EAC, followed by Dodoma and Kampala. Data showed that in 2013 Kenya had 110 individuals in this category. The number increased to 125 last year and projected to balloon by 24 per cent to 155 in 2023. Tanzania had 75 in 2013 and increased to 88 in 2018 while expected to reach 107, or 22 per cent increase in 2023. Uganda had 20 in 2013 and rose slightly to 22 in 2018 and expected to reach 27 in 2023, equal to 23 per cent increase. The report further highlights: “As wealth moves more rapidly around the world, investors will become increasingly active in their investment strategies. Rising interest rates and the end of quantitative easing mean we are reaching the end of the ‘everything bubble’”.
