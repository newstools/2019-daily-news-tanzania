THE Minister for Minerals, Doto Biteko has said he is committed to relentlessly find solutions on challenges facing Tanzanians in the mining sector. The minister said here during his working tour of Bukombe District in Geita Region that he will work on all the problems facing miners in the country, particularly in the gold-rich land of Bukombe District. He also said the same measures will be equally taken in ensuring that Bukombe residents had proper access of clean and safe water, education, health, community development, infrastructure and putting measures in place that will help people with disabilities to access all the important social services. Addressing residents of different villages in Ushirombo and Bugelenga wards of Bukombe District, Mr Biteko urged the residents to build a spirit of hard work and ensure that they hate and condemn poverty at any cost. He gave an example of his family, saying he grew up in a poor family to an extent that he was branded a new name of ‘Milk,’ because to a greater extent his education costs depended on the sale of milk by his parents to enable him go to school. “I want to tell you that I have visited many countries which have people who are in extreme poverty than our country, therefore if you are physically fit, I urge you to intensify hard work so that we can bring change in Bukombe District,’’ he said.
