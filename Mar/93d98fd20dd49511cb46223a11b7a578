Recounting on the incident, Mr Lugwisha, who identified himself as brother-in-law of the deceased, said on the material day, Manyanya accompanied by other six people boarded a boat set for Mpenje village to meet with other CCM members, adding: “Manyanya and his colleagues from Kabwe village to Mpenje…. docked at Mpenje and shortly after disembarking, a swarm of bees attacked them. “His six colleagues accompanying him managed to escape only to leave the swarm at his mercy and they violently attacked him,” he added.

Sending his condolence, the CCM Nkasi District Publicity Secretary, Juma Kiboko said on behalf of CCM, said that they were saddened by the demise of the leader, and prayed that his bereaved family as well as others touched by the death accept what nature has dictated. According to Medline Plus Medical Encyclopedia, bee, wasp, hornet, and yellow jacket stings contain a substance called venom, which is poisonous to human life when injected in a big quantity. However, Africa bee colonies are very sensitive and respond fast enough and in big numbers than other types of bees worldwide, and they are much more likely to sting than the European ones.
