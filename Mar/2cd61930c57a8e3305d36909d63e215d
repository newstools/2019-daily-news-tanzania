RETIRED Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda has called on Manyara residents to persevere the situation as they face a shortage of water for there is light at the end of the tunnel. Mr Pinda told Imbili, Malangi and Maisaka villagers that it was true water was mostly available in urban areas, while many villages lacked the precious liquid, but asked them to persevere as efforts were being made to get water in the future. The former premier, who is CCM Manyara Regional guardian, was on a tour of water projects. He said President John Magufuli’s fifth phase government had been doing a good job since it came to power three years ago in the provision of social services. He said in three years, 53bn/- had been spent on water services in Manyara Region alone, so in the near future the challenge would be addressed. “I have toured many places in this region and I have seen for myself the challenge of water shortage. You are human beings, you may cry to me over that problem. Know that also cattle face the same challenge. If only they could speak, the language would have been very bitter. We know it is a challenge and the authorities are working on it to get it addressed,” said Mr Pinda. He noted that the region had 18 water projects, 11 of which had been completed, while seven were at different stages and the government was doing all it could to complete them on time. He said at times some projects were not completed due to negligence at district council level, while appointing an accusing finger at contractors.
