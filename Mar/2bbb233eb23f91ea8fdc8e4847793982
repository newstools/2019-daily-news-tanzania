IN a bid to boost tourism, Katavi Region has officially launched a ten-year strategic plan which will see Katavi National Park in Mlele District become a hub of tourism attractions in the Southern Highlands circuit. Katavi National Park is the Tanzania’s third largest national park and is the heart of one of the biggest and richest wildlife areas in Tanzania. The revelation was made by the Katavi Regional Commissioner, Mr Amos Makala, while launching a ten year strategic plan, at Katavi National Park in Mlele District. With a size of 4,471 square kilometres, Katavi National Park contributes massively to conservation. It is the core of the western Tanzanian wildlife area and part of Katavi/Rukwa ecosystem with roughly 12,500 square kilometres. Rukwa and Lukwati are Game Reserves used for trophy hunting for foreign tourists. Being an undisturbed natural landscape, Katavi National Park has the highest hippo and crocodile population in the country as the animals rely on Lake Katavi with its vast short grass flood plains in the north, the palm fringed Lake Chada in the southeast, and the Katuma River for water throughout the year. “Since the Katavi Region was officially established seven years ago, the home of the National Park which was officially created in 1974 , regrettably, no plan was prepared to strategise promotion of tourism attractions despite the abundance of rare fauna and flora richness in its national park and game reserves,” added the RC. Mr Makala further explained that the regional government was aware of the need to promote untapped tourism potentials in Katavi Region which can help improve further the standard of the locals and significantly raise more revenue for the region as well as the State at large.
