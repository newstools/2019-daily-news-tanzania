AZAM FC caretaker coach Idd Cheche said he was impressed with the performance of his team after racing into the semifinals of Azam Sports Federation Cup (ASFC). A slender 1-0 victory over Kagera Sugar at Kaitaba Stadium in Bukoba was enough to drive Azam into the last four of the lucrative competition, whose winner represent the country in the CAF Confederation Cup. It was Joseph Mahundi who poached and scored the only goal of the tense match in the second half which consequently dumped out the Sugarcane growers’ team from the contest. Donald Ngoma played a sweet penetration pass to the left side of the pitch which found already racing Mahundi, who overran Kagera Sugar defenders before firing the ball into the net. Azam finished the game minus one player after their first choice goalkeeper, Razak Abalora was given marching orders for his reckless challenge on the Kagera Sugar player at the edge of the penalty box. Abalora slashed his opponent from behind an offence which usually attracts a red card in football but maturity and focus saw the ‘Ice cream makers’ cruising into the last four category. Speaking after the match, Cheche said he was happy with the results despite playing with one man short. “As you saw, it was a difficult game since our opponents were equally good and gave us challenges. We conceded a silly red card but my boys did not lose momentum until we scored the winning goal,” Cheche said. He added that after the ASFC, they will now divert their energy towards the Mainland Premier League and they expect to face Kagera Sugar in their next fixture of the top flight league. “All Azam supporters should rally behind us because we are ready to fight until the last drop of our blood in both ASFC and top flight league,” the coach said. Cheche is yet to lose a match at the helm of Azam after taking over the coaching duties from the former coach Hans Van Pluijm who was fired amid poor performance allegations
