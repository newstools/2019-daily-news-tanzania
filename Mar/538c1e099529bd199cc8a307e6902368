HAI District Council has recovered 29.8m/- that was fraudulently obtained by Uswaa-Mamba Savings and Credit Cooperative Society (Uswaa-Mamba Saccos) members. Another whopping 67.7m/- is still unaccounted for with Hai District Commissioner (DC) Lengai Ole Sabaya, urging embezzlers to surrender themselves. Speaking at a meeting with Uswaa-Mamba Saccos members yesterday, the DC said the money was yet to be returned to Uswaa-Mamba Saccos even after issuing stern warnings. Mr Ole Sabaya warned that those found implicated in the scandal would face legal action. “Since the warnings have fallen on deaf ears, the culprits will now be dealt with squarely,” cautioned the DC. During the meeting, Mr Ole Sabaya told off a district cooperative officer for illadvising him on a procedure to distribute the recovered money. Likewise, the DC warned cooperative society leaders against their plot to defraud Uswaa-Mamba Saccos, urging them to respect the rights of their members. “The money will only be shared amongst you once a review is conducted on each member’s contribution,” he said. He urged the members to shun selfishness, warning that, whoever defied such a directive would be held accountable.
