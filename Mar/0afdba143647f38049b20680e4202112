THE Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) has seized substandard iron roofing sheets valued at over 184m/- locally manufactured by four internal companies in its day long inspection carried out in Sumbawanga Town in Rukwa region recently. The TBS Senior Inspector, Engineer Manema Donald made the revelation to reporters in the Municipality here yesterday, in a press briefing meeting noting that their inspection confiscated 7,680 pieces of the substandard , iron sheets, which will be publicly destroyed. However, he alerted both local and international manufactures to enhance quality of their products circulating in the country, which meet their required set standards. “Roofing iron sheets popularly known as Msauzi G 30 have been prohibited to be manufactured as per standards of Tanzania, because the required standards is between G 26 and 28, unfortunately local manufactures have been manufacturing such substandards in closed doors,” pointed out Eng Donald. He further called upon the public who have purchased and used the iron sheets to consult the suppliers, so that they are refunded their money or given standardised ones. “The fine for manufacturing substandard commodities including iron sheets is 20m/-, which will go hand in hand with a penalty of 3.5m/- as costs for destroying them,” the TBS Senior Inspector added.
