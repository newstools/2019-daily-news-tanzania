TANZANIA Kabaddi Sports Association (TKSA) has requested the government, corporate firms and well-wishers to support the national team heading to Malaysia for the World Cup championship. The 2019 Kabbadi World Cup Competition is scheduled to be staged from April 2nd to 15th this year in Melaka, Malaysia. TKSA chairman Abdallah Nyoni told the ‘Daily News’ in Dar es Salaam yesterday that preparation is going on well, but the only seatback is financial constraints. He said the teams need return tickets, sport’s kits, shoes and allowances. He calls the minister responsible with sports and India High Commissioner to Tanzania to support the teams with sports gear. “Preparation is on a top gear, teams have been training intensively in Dar es Salaam ready for the event, but until today, we have not yet secured uniform and return tickets.” Nyoni added: “We still need support so that we can have a good competition; it will be shame if the national teams enter the competition arena without a proper kit.” The chairman said that the door is open for companies, institutions and sports well-wishers wishing to support the team so that they can raise high the national flag in Melaka. National Kabaddi in the camp for the World Cup finals comprises Joseph Lusinde, Best Ibrahim, Imraan Nyoni, Shija Butiku, Athumani Lucas, Joseph Mkinga, Pascal John, Hussein Mbembati, Masudi Tindwa , Roland Aswile, Masanja Mtemu, Shigela Magobo and Abdallah Athumani (men’s team).
