TOTAL of 128,285 students are expected to benefit from loans issued by the Higher Education Students' Loans Board (HESLB) in the next academic year, it was announced in Dar es Salaam yesterday. The number of beneficiaries in the next academic year will increase by 5,200 students, bearing in mind that in the 2018/19 academic year, HESLB issued loans to 123,085 students. Speaking to reporters, HESLB Head of Corporate Communication Omega Ngole said 450bn/- was expected to be spent in the next academic year, an increase of 22.5bn/-. He said out of the 128,285 beneficiaries expected to receive loans in the coming academic year, 50,000 of them would be first year students, an increase of 9,715 students, given the fact that in the 2018/19 academic year, 40,285 first year students received loans. "The government through HESLB has planned to issue 450b/- loans to benefit 128,285 students for the 2019/20 academic year," Mr Ngole, who was flanked by Deputy Minister for Education, Science and Technology William Ole Nasha said. The loans will also benefit 78,285 continuing students. In 2018/19, the government set aside 427bn/- to lend to 123,085 beneficiaries, including 40,285 first year and 82,800 continuing students. Mr Ngole noted that until March 8 this year, HESLB had issued 423.5bn/- to 122,775 students and among them there were 41,285 first year and 81,490 continuing students. "The issuance of loans to the remaining students is in process in line with the information provided," he said. On the other hand, Mr Ngole told the meeting that HESLB had collected 109.bn/- from beneficiaries. The money was collected between July 2018 and January this year. According to Mr Ngole, HESLB plans to collect 150bn/- in 2018/19. In January alone, it collected 14.9bn/-. Commenting on the report, Mr Ole Nasha commended HESLB for the achievements it had made in terms of issuing and collecting loans from beneficiaries. "We have seen a lot of improvement in terms of issuing and collecting loans from beneficiaries and we (government) acknowledge the efforts you have made in this regard,” he said. He, however, asked HESLB to review the process of disbursing loans to universities mainly to benefit selected beneficiaries. The process should go in line with getting rid of dishonest HESLB officers for efficiency. Mr Ole Nasha revealed that some of the HESLB officers were dishonest, when selecting beneficiaries. “We have had a lot of complaints concerning the officers who have turned themselves into gods, mismanaging money on top of the required amount from loan applicants as an application fee,” he said, adding that the move had always led to the presentation of inappropriate information about loan applicants. He told HESLB to ensure each university with loan beneficiaries should have a bank account for the applicant’s loan. “To ensure efficiency in the issuance of loans, you (HESLB) should come up with a plan to monitor the accounts to ensure they are beneficiaries’ loan accounts,” he said. On the other hand, Mr Ole Nasha directed HESLB to take legal action against employers, who had failed to comply with directives on the presentation of the names of graduates owing HESLB. “If you take two of the employers failing to comply with the law, it will deter the rest from ignoring the rules and directives issued,” he said. The Deputy Minister directed HESLB to review loan application forms to help applicants understand and fill them as required. He said the majority of applicants had failed to fill in the forms as required and thus making them miss the loans or present incorrect information.
