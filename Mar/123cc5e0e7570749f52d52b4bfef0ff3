TANZANIAN Emmanuel Giniki won the home crowd applause at the Kilimanjaro Premium Lager Marathon 2019 held in Moshi yesterday. Giniki swept out competent Kenyans to win the Tigo Kilimanjaro Half Marathon men’s category, while in the women’s discipline, Tanzanian Failuna Matanga crossed the finishing point at Moshi Cooperative University (MoCU) in second place. Thousands of runners from different countries competed in the prestigious event, sanctioned by the International Association Athletics Federation (IAAF). Giniki won a heroic welcome at a fully-packed finish ground, after he clocked at 1 hour, 03 minutes and 34 seconds to win the gold medal as nine Kenyans followed after him. Benard Musau, Joseph Njijia and Nyambani Haron finished second, third and fourth, clocking at 01:03:42, 01:05:13 and 01:05:31, respectively. The other half marathon’s Kenyan winners (from fifth to tenth) and their respective timings in brackets are Benson Mutiso (01:06 : 01), Godfrey Kirwa (01:06 : 09 ), Mathew Kibet (01:06 : 18 ), Paul Mutihya (01:06 : 39 ), Mathias Koech (01:06 : 42) and Joseph Mumo who finished at 01:06 : 53. “I feel proud of my home victory, it was a tough race. The last 100 metres before the finish line was the hardest to me because my opponents were closely running after me, but I pulled up to make sure that I beat them all,” said Giniki, who also won the 2017 half marathon of the same race. In the women’s discipline (half marathon), Grace Kimanzi of Kenya continued her prowess, winning the race for the fourth time in a row since 2015. “I trained very hard while in Kenya, thank God I made it again. My coach, Paul Muthui always tells me to aim high for medals and that is what I did,” said Kimanzi of Machakos Club as she clocked at 01:11:45 to bag home a gold medal. Failuna clocked at 01:14:01 to win the second place but bemoaned her ‘ falling down’ at the starting point, saying it denied her full strength to win the first spot. Kenyan Esther Kakuri won the third spot at 01:14:42 as her compatriot, Nancy Wambua came fourth as 01:17:19 . The fifth place was snatched by a Kenyan Mercy Mwangi (01:19 : 56 ) as Sara Ramadhani of Tanzania came sixth at 01:20:00. Kenyans, as their tradition, dominated in the full marathon (in both men and women disciplines). In the men’s Kilimanjaro Premium Lager’s full marathon, only Tanzanian Stephano Huche emerged in the seventh place to leave the Kenyans winning all other top ten slots. Tanzanians Fabiola William and Banuelia Katesigwa emerged sixth and eighth in the women’s full marathon, out of top ten. Cosmas Muteti defended his full marathon title at 02 hours, 18 minutes and 27 seconds to win the first spot as David Kipkorir came second at 02:18 : 48 .
