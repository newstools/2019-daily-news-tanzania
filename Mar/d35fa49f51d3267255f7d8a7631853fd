... It is among major highlights of the proposed 2019/2020 budget THE government expects to spend 33.1tri/- in the 2019/2020 Financial Year, against 32.5tri/- it targeted to spend in the current (2018/2019) Fiscal Year. This means that in the next Fiscal Year, there will be an increment of over 600bn/-, an equivalent of 1.9per cent. The money, according to the Minister of Finance and Planning, Dr Philip Mpango, is expected to be sourced from tax and non-tax revenues, Local Government Authorities (LGAs), aid and grants from Development Partners (DPs) as well as local and external Concessional Loans. Dr Philip Mpango said that in the next financial year, the government plans to spend 20.9tri/- in recurrent expenditure, which will include financing of the 2019 civic polls and preparations for the country’s General Election next year. He added that development expenditure for the 2019/2020 budget is expected to be 12.2tri/- while 9.7tri/- will be from internal revenue collection, and 2.5tri/- will be from external revenue sources. Dr Mpango, who was presenting the National Development Plan and the budget ceiling for 2019/2020, told Members of Parliament yesterday that the focus of the next budget would remain on building an industrial economy that will stimulate employment and social welfare. According to him, by considering the 2019/2020 Budget Policy, in order to properly execute the 33.1tri/- budget, 23tri/- will be obtained from internal revenue sources, loans from local financial institutions (5tri/-), foreign loans with business conditions (2.3tri/), and development partners (2.8tri/-). At the meeting which was chaired by Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa and attended by National Assembly Speaker Job Ndugai, the finance minister said the government would continue sealing loopholes for tax evasion. “We shall insist on proper utilisation of the government’s money by investing in public infrastructure and social services in our bid to expedite development,’’ he said. He added that the government was similarly committed to intensifying the war against graft and embezzlement of public funds as well as improving the investment environment in the country.
