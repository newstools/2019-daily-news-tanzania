PAMBA head coach, Ally Kisaka has assured the team’s supporters and the club management of good results in their remaining six matches of the First Division League. Kisaka, whose team lost two consecutive matches recently, said they will work very hard to win the remaining six matches so as to earn promotion to the Premier League next season. The former Union Cup champions lost to Mashujaa FC 2-1 at the Lake Tanganyika Stadium in Kigoma and then suffered a 1-0 loss to Police Tanzania at Ushirika Stadium in Moshi, Kilimanjaro. Commenting on his team’s performance, the coach said poor officiating during their matches against Mashujaa FC and Police Tanzania played part in their both defeats. He said he was confident that his players would work hard in order to win their remaining matches. The former league champions are now lined up for their weekend league match against Geita Gold at Nyamagana Stadium. Pamba will then face Arusha United, Boma FC and Rhino Rangers at their home ground while their away matches will be against Green Warriors at Chamazi Complex in Dar es Salaam and AFC Arusha at Sheikh Amri Abeid Memorial Stadium in Arusha. Pamba are now placed fourth in the league table after gathering 26 points in their last 16 outings. They have netted 2 3 and conceded 16 goals. They have won eight, drawn two and lost six matches. On his side, Pamba FC captain Salum Kipemba promised to work hard with his fellow players so as to win their remaining matches.
