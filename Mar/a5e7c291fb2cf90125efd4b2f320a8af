PRESIDENT Ali Mohamed Shein has congratulated the national team, Taifa Stars on their victory over their Uganda counterpart, the Cranes, last Sunday in Dar es Salaam. "Warm congratulations to the players, coach, technical team, the management team, and Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) for the good work," Shein said in a statement from the State House, urging the team to work harder. Both teams Taifa Stars and Uganda Cranes have made it to the tournament in Egypt, but Dr Shein asked the Taifa Stars to strive harder to bring this year's AFCON trophy home (United Republic of Tanzania).
