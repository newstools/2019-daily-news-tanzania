IN improving provision of transport service to the public, Uber launched its new ‘Uber Lite App to enable users of android phone to easily access the service. Speaking in Dar es Salaam yesterday during the launch, the Uber Sub-Saharan Africa’s General Manager Alon Lits said after extensive study they redesigned the entire user experience to be simpler based on riders’ suggestions. “Every day, hundreds of thousands of Tanzanians rely on Uber services for mobility and work, and we understand that a one-size-fits-all app doesn’t work for the diversity of network conditions, devices, and rider needs across the country,” Mr Lits said. According to him, Uber Lite’s new interface was designed to make booking rides quicker and lighter in low connectivity (2G), on basic Android phones, and for people with limited data plans. The app is now available in Tanzania and Uganda following the similar launch in Kenya and South Africa in January. The App is a simpler version of the Uber App which works on any android phone while saving storage space and data. Plus, it’s easy to learn and use, and it’s designed to work even in low connectivity areas. Explaining further on the app, Uber’s Communication Officer, Janet Kemboi said it guides users through the request experience by detecting their current location, so minimal typing is required. If it can’t detect your location because of GPS or network issues, it guides you to choose popular landmarks nearby such as the churches— which is how most people in the country communicate their location. Overall, the Uber network is available in over 600 cities in over 65 countries.
