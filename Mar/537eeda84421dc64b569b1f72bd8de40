BARCLAY S Bank Tanzania has said the transition to a new Absa brand is the unique opportunity to leverage its rich African heritage and deep understanding of the local market to unlock Tanzania’s potential and supports its growth. This was said in Dar es Salaam yesterday by the Barclays Bank Tanzania Managing Director, Abdi Mohamed at the briefing on Absa Group Limited 2018 full year financials that reported an increase in revenue and earnings. “As we join in reflecting on our parent company’s full year results for 2018, we are excited by our own future as we make progress on our journey to the new Absa brand in Tanzania,” he said. The development comes after the London-based Barclays Plc sold most of its controlling stake in Absa to end more than a century of the British bank’s involvement in Africa. Absa Regional Operations Chief Executive, Peter Matlare said, “We are pleased with the contribution of our African operations to Absa Group’s overall performance and remain focused on contributing to the Group’s ambition of growing revenue market share on the continent over the coming years.” According to the report, 2018 was a year of almost unprecedented corporate activity as the group repositioned itself for delivery against a new growth strategy as an independent African bank. Normalised headline earnings increased by 3 per cent to R16.1 billion compared with 2017 and revenue increased by 4 per cent to R75.7 billion. “Despite a challenging backdrop, we are particularly pleased with our improved momentum as we embark on our new growth strategy. This was evident in our gross loans to customers which increased by 13 per cent,” said Jason Q uinn, Absa Group Financial Director. “Last year was a year of almost unprecedented activity for Absa Group as the business was re-set as an independent bank after Barclays Plc reduced its shareholding to a minority stake in 2017,” said René van Wyk, Absa Group CEO.
