WOMEN in the country have been challenged to support each other for them to realise their goals. This remark was made in Dar es Salaam on Friday by the Medical Store Department Women’s Chairperson, Ms Rehema Mosha during commemoration of the International Women’s Day. Ms Mosha said that with this year’s campaign theme being #BalanceforBetter, women should cooperate and lift each other up instead of being tools of holding each other down. “Women should think of lifting their fellow women up so that they can also realise their goals,” Ms Mosha said. MSD women celebrated the IWD by visiting the Kangaroo Mother Care Unit at Muhimbili National Hospital ( MNH) and handed over various items to mothers and their newborns. They included wipes, diapers, bathing soaps, khangas, powder soaps and toothpaste among others worth 2.8 m/-. Ms Mosha noted that they decided to donate the items to mothers and newborns at the kangaroo ward because they stay longer at the hospital. “Mothers in this ward stay up to 90 days until their children have gained the required weight,” she said. She called upon women from other institutions to consider supporting the Kangaroo Mother Care unit because some of the patients were from very poor families and they cannot afford to buy all the requirements during their stay at the hospital. On her part, In–Charge of the Kangaroo Mother Care Unit, Ms Cleopatra Mtei said that the ward was responsible for caring for preterm infants being taken care of by their mother through skin-to-skin contact. She commended MSD women for the gifts which she said will be very useful to the mothers and the infants.. She called upon other institutions to support the unit since the mothers stay at the hospital for a long time and sometime they lacked important items needed for caring the babies and themselves. This year’s International Women’s Day campaign theme of #BalanceforBetter is a call-to-action for driving gender balance across the world.
