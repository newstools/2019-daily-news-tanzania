CHADEMA National Chairman Freeman Mbowe and Tarime Urban Member of Parliament Ester Matiko on Thursday got relief when the High Court restored their bail canceled by Kisutu Resident Magistrate’s Court in Dar es Salaam three months ago for violating bond conditions. Judge Sam Rumanyika ordered the immediate release from remand prison after allowing the appeal the two senior officials of the country’s main opposition party had lodged to fault the decision given by Principal Resident Magistrate Wilbard Mashauri, as he then was, on November 23, 2018. “This appeal is allowed. The appellants (Mbowe and Matiko) are to be released from remand prison forthwith unless held legally therein. I direct the records of proceedings to be remitted to the trial court with immediate effect for continuation of hearing the trial,” he declared. The judge ruled that the decision by the lower court to cancel bail to Mbowe and Matiko, as appellants, was premature. He pointed out that bail was a contract between the court, accused and sureties, who sign bond before the accused is bailed out.
