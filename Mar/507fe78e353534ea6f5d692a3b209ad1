MINERALS Minister, Doto Biteko has expressed his commitment to ensuring that investors in the mining sector are paying all statutory taxes to the government as per the country’s legislation. The minister said this while addressing residents in Bukombe district during a three-day working tour of Geita region, where he asked residents to tap the potentials available in their district which is rich in gold minerals. Mr Biteko said he will ensure that all the taxes were paid on time as he asked residents in Bukombe district to dedicate their contribution to the national development. “Do not sit down and expect to receive everything from the investors, you also need to work hard so that we contribute to the country’s development as the government continues tightening loopholes of tax evasion by businesspeople investing in the mining sector,’’ he said. According to Mr Biteko, Bukombe was rich in minerals and that its people were not supposed to remain poor. He advised all young people, men and women in the district to work hard so that they can get out of poverty. Mr Biteko who doubles as a Member of Parliament for Bukombe Constituency said he was fully determined to ensuring that all people in the district were benefiting from the country’s natural resources in his efforts to support President John Magufuli’s ambitious dream to all Tanzanians. “As a minister and Bukombe MP, there is no need for me to stay in office if I will not be able to address challenges facing the mining sector and every time I wake up in the morning, I have been thinking of how to transform the mining sector for the benefit of the entire nation,’’ he added. He said Dr Magufuli has always been insisting on public officials to go out and find solutions for the problems facing people instead of staying in the office.
