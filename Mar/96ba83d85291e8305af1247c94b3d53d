TANZANIA Media Women Association (TAMWA)- Zanzibar has launched a ‘Male Change Agent Team (MCAT)’ that aims to change mindset of the community towards women full participation in political leaderships. The 20 member team was formed by personalities from different groups namely religious, council, and community leaders, as well as members from political parties, civil society organisations and some males who champion for women and children involvement issues. MCAT with ten members from Unguja and others from Pemba, is expected to conduct dialogue meetings in all 11 districts in Zanzibar. According to Zanzibar TAMWA Director, Dr Mzuri Issa, the task-force has been empowered with special tools on how to reach the society and to analyse issues on gender perspective. “Soon the public sensitisation programme in different Shehias in the Isles will start with the aim of changing people’s mindset towards women, in preparation for the next general elections,” she pointed out, adding that some attitudes hinder women’s participation in political contest posts. During the launch ceremony of the ‘Male Change Agent team’, TAMWA veteran activist, Ms Ummie Mahfoudha Alley, was of the views that members of the society ‘just contradict’ themselves on positions of women, “while it is well known that women have been performing better as mothers, wives and leaders at the same time.” The team was launched at TAMWA’s Hall in Tunguu area, South of Unguja where it was said that history shows that women have proved to perform better as leaders, where they cited, Ms Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka, who was the Prime Minister for three terms; 1960–1965, 1970–1977 and 1994–2000 in her country. “This was at the period when the idea of a woman leading a country was almost unthinkable in the public, and Bandaranaike helped to raise the global perception of women. And also first female elected Head of State in the African continent was once Ms Ellen Sirleaf of Liberia, whose legacy installed harmony and peace after years of conflicts,” added Ms Alley.
