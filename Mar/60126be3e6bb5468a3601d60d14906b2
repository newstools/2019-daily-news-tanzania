DEPUTY Minister for Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development, Dr Angelina Mabula, has directed Councils countrywide to set aside some budget to facilitate functions of Village Land Councils (VLC) and Ward Tribunals (WT). Expounding, she said many Ward Tribunals lack funds to finance their operations, despite the law requiring the District Executive Directors (DEDs) to facilitate the operations including budgeting for their recurrent expenditure. Dr Mabula, who visited Kagera Region recently noted that experience shows that District Councils do not include any budgetary allocation to finance the VLCs and Ward Tribunals. “Lack of funding exposes and tempts VLC and WT members to be corrupt and bend rules in favour of clients who have money. Experience and practices on the ground has shown that instead of mediating, many VLCs are charging fines and imposing compensation orders, contrary to the stipulated law of the land. “VLCs are legally mandated to undertake mediation between the aggrieved parties,” she said. On his part, Chairman of Bukoba District Land and Housing Tribunal, Mr Emmanuel Mogasa noted that Bukoba District Land and Housing Tribunal has a big workload, with records showing that it registers between 6 0 and 7 0 land related cases per month. Currently, the district has 1,051 pending land related cases. According to him, out of the pending cases, 305 were Applications, 249 Appeals and 497 Miscellaneous Applications. He appealed to the government to intervene in the course and recruit more staff for the purpose, noting that currently he was handling the Tribunal alone. “This negatively affects operations of the Bukoba District Land and Housing Tribunal, which also serves three Districts of Missenyi, Bukoba Rural and Bukoba Municipal,” he pointed out.
