THE Tanzania Swimming Association (TSA) has formed a special committee to oversee the incoming National Swimming Club Championship (TNCC), set for April 13th to 14th this year, at the International School of Tanganyika (IST) in Dar es Salaam. Hadija Shebe is the Committee’s Chairperson of the two day contest and has been tasked to ensure that enough funds are raised to facilitate smooth running of the big swimming event expected to attract both local and international swimmers. Speaking here yesterday, Shebe said for the first time in the history of swimming in the country, the competition has been endorsed to be the World Swimming Governing Body (FINA) 2019 World Championship qualifying event whose finals will be staged in Kwangju, Korea from July 12th to 28th. “Swimmers of different age groups are expected to compete in various swimming styles ranging from Butterfly, Freestyle, Individual Medley (IM), Backstroke and Breaststroke. They will also compete in Relays,” Shebe said. Adding, the chairperson called upon young Tanzanians both girls and boys aged 14 years and above to embrace the competition to stand a chance of being picked to join the national team. She said: “Only those swimmers who will manage to beat the qualifying time would win the chance to represent the country in the forthcoming world swimming event in Korea.” Additionally, Shebe revealed that they are now working around the clock seeking sponsors to assist them in making the competition colourful and successful. According to her, other committee members are Isabella Faya, Priscilla Zengeni, Martha Makoi, Maryam Gomite, Girija Raghavendran, Mary Mugurusi, Geeta Gorkarn and Frank Goyayi.
