THE Rukwa Regional Commissioner, Mr Joachim Wangabo, says Nakuroi Investment has been withdrawn from the REA III project due to under-performance. He says the contractor had failed to connect even half of the 111 envisaged villages with electricity between November 2017 when the contract was signed to last month. Mr Wangabo made the revelation while addressing the Rukwa Regional Consultative Committee meeting held over the week end. He said the firm connected only 23 villages by last month. “The region has 339 villages; the Ministry of Energy should do something about the anomaly; I am declaring that when the contract with Nakuroi Investment expires I won’t renew it,” he said emphatically. On his part, the Acting Rukwa Region Tanesco manager , Eng Gilles Daniel, admitted that implementation REA III project in the region had been stalled due to the many challenges the contractor and Tanesco were facing, including shortage of eq uipment. Speaking at the meeting, the MP for Sumbawanga Urban Constituency, Mr Aish Hilaly, said it was unfair to blame Tanesco for the poor inadeq uacies of the contractor, adding legislators in the region should bring up the issue during the next Bunge session, in pursuit of a permanent solution.
