ABOUT 54 per cent of households in three districts of Bahi, Chamwino and Kongwa have improved their access to sanitations, thanks to National Sanitation Campaign Progamme. Under the auspices of Plan International, in its programme that goes by Kiswahili name of ‘Usafi wa Mazingira Tanzania (UMATA), according to the organisation’s Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist, Joyce Masile, it is aimed at sensitising the public and institutions on the importance of sanitation improvements. “The programme has managed to support the District Councils to improve their access to sanitation and hygiene facilities to 47 per cent as of December, 2018,” she pointed out, during a recent media visit to the programme beneficiaries at Nolini village in Kongwa. The UMATA programme is jointly carried out by the Community Development and Relief Trust (CODERT), People Development Forum (PDF) and Social and Economic Development Initiative of Tanzania (SEDIT) and Sanitation and Water Action (SAWA). Ms Masile noted that the programme emphasizes improvements on privacy, for instance roofing, which has proved to help the people on how to roof their pit latrine against ‘nuisance’ during the rainy seasons. She pointed out that the programme amongst other key components and activities, has accelerated results in the public, for it triggers societies to work on the issues led by Community Total Sanitation. “The approach was implemented in 170 villages in the districts of Bahi, Chamwino and Kongwa. Targeted at sparking behaviour change to the community members on sanitation and hygiene issues,” she observed. On her side, SAWA and UMATA Project Officer, Ms Agnes Erio, said the latter’s scheme has registered great achievements in Bahi, Chamwino and Kongwa, adding that it has also facilitated improvements of sanitations in the areas. “The programme has tremendously helped to prevent epidemic diseases such as cholera,” she said.
