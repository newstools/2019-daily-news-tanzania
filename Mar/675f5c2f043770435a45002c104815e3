MUSLIMS in Dar es Salaam yesterday came together to pray for rain and God’s protection from deadly disasters. The prayers which were held at Mnazi Mmoja in Ilala and Mwembe Yanga grounds in Temeke municipality in the region were led by Sheikh Sharif Ahmed Badawy. The prayers come as a response to the current drought which has caused panic amongst members of the public, largely crop growers and cattle keepers. Speaking after prayers, Mufti of Tanzania Sheikh Abubakar Zubeir said all Muslims countrywide have been conducting prayers for rain since last week and prayers are ongoing. Mufti has further urged all Tanzanians according to their beliefs to continue praying so that the country get rains and disasters are avoided. “We are part of the Tanzanian community, drought affects farmers and water sources and aquatic organisms are in danger. We love this country so we need to pray for it,” he said. In his speech after prayers, Sheikh Hassan Chizenga reminded all people to live according to God’s wishes and refrain from sins, which he said were sometimes responsible for disasters. Last month, the Tanzania Meteorological Agency (TMA) forecast that residents of the Lake Zone, Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Dar es Salaam regions and Zanzibar should brace for heavy downpours. The TMA Director General, Dr Agnes Kijazi, told reporters that some regions would receive above-normal long rains expected from early March to late May. She named the regions as Kagera, Mara, Mwanza, Geita, Simiyu, Shinyanga, Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Kilimanjaro and Zanzibar. The rest of the country would receive normal rains, the meteorology chief stated. Dr Kijazi said long rains were expected to start in the middle of the last week of February in Dar es Salaam, Tanga, Zanzibar, Arusha, Manyara, Kilimanjaro and northerly parts of Morogoro Region.
