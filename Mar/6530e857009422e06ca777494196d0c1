NASSORO Haroub (52), a carpenter from Hamugembe Ward in Bukoba Municipal Council told the court that coffin prices are normally negotiable and there is no fixed price. He was testifying as Public Witness (PW 11) in a case facing former Kagera Regional Administrative Secretary (RAS) Amantius Msole. Haroub told the court that he owned a kiosk along Machinjioni Street where he produced and sold coffins of different sizes, adding that small size coffins cost between 50,000/- and 90,000/-, medium size cost 150,000/- and large coffins were sold between 200,000/- and 270,000/-. Other accused in an economic case No 6/2018 are former Kagera Regional Chief Accountant Simbaufoo Swai (53) and CRDB Bukoba Branch Manager Karlo Sendwa (56). Prosecuting before Resident Magistrate Joseph Luambano, State Attorney Chema Maswi told the court that in the first count the three accused were jointly charged with abuse of position contrary to section 31 of the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Act No 11 of 2007. The particulars of the offence indicate that on September 19, 2016 within the Municipal Council and District of Bukoba, the accused intentionally abused their positions for purposes of obtaining undue advantage for themselves by opening an account No 0150225617300 named “Kamati ya Maafa Kagera” at CRDB Bank, Bukoba Branch. According to Maswi, the Prime Minister had directed the Kagera regional authorities to open account No 0152225617300 at CRDB Bank, Bukoba Branch to collect donations to support Kagera earthquake victims. Maswi further told the court that between September 23 and 24, 2016, Msole and Swai misused their office contrary to provisions of the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Act by purchasing various merchandise worth 11,121,565/- from Krupa General Stores and contrary to the Public Procurement Act, obtaining undue advantages. In the third count, it was alleged that between September 23 and 24, 2016 Msole and Swai misused their office by buying coffins and shroud bundles worth 1,975,000/- from Mr Fortunatus Mbeyanga without consent from the Regional Tender Board (RTB). The three accused pleaded not guilty to the charges. Msole and Swai are being represented by Bukoba-based counsel Josephat Rweyemamu, while Sendwa is being represented by counsel Aaron Kabunga. Magistrate Luambano set bail conditions that each accused should get two sureties after signing a 10m/- bond. The accused were also ordered to surrender their passports/travel documents and should not travel outside Kagera Region without leave of the court. Msole, Swai, Sendwa and former Bukoba Municipal Director Kelvin Makonda were earlier charged in a criminal case No 239/2016 and criminal case No 80/2017, but the two cases were discharged for lack of consent from DPP.
