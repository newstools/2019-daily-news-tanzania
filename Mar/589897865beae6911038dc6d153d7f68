YOUNGSTER Isihaka Daudi fought hard to beat top Division A contenders to win top prize at Friday’s Weekly Fiddle tournament at Tanzania People’s Defence Forces (TPDF) Lugalo Golf Club of Dar es Salaam. The youngster’s game continues to improve tremendously since he was selected to represent Tanzania at the All-Africa Junior Challenge in Morocco last year. Daudi stepped up to join other top golfers, who have made their names in the weekly battle. Handicap-5 Daudi fought hard to beat top Division A contenders to win top prize after posting an impressive one-under 37 stable ford points to win title by two shots over his closest challenger. Marius Kajuna also handicap- 5, was two shots adrift the champion after he returned 35 points in the 18 holes club night event. Kajuna has dominated the tournament since it was officially opened last month. Daudi was happy to grab top prize saying, he will keep fighting hard to improve even further ready for major competitions. “I’m happy for the feat. I have been working hard in practice to be able to challenge top and experienced opponents, and today (Friday) it has paid off. I will keep fighting and be ready for major competitions because I have good support from club that brought me where I am today,” said Daudi.
