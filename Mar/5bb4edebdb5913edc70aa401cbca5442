She hinted that already the bank has done much in the agricultural sector by providing the farmers with loans in their chains of activities. “NMB keeps safely clients’ money and releases loans to deserving and in need customers. On the side of agriculture, we have loans to peasants and farmers in the hierarchy, buyers and transporters of the crops,” pointed out the Manager.
