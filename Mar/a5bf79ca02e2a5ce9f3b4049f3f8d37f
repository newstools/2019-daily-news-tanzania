TANZANIA is ready to host Under - 21 Zone Five African Nations Championship Beach Volleyball Qualifying Competition, scheduled to start from Thursday to Friday at Mbalamwezi Beach Hotel in Dar es Salaam. The Zonal qualifying competition was earlier scheduled for last month, but was rescheduled to this month due to several reasons. Tanzania Amateur Volleyball Association (TAVA) Secretary, Alfred Selengia told the ‘Daily News’ yesterday that preparations are on top gear for them to host the prestigious competition that is organised in collaboration with the African Volleyball Confederation (CAVB). Selengia said that the competition that serves as the African Nations qualifying will bring together top East African countries. Countries that have already confirmed their participation so far are Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia and Burundi, while Rwanda are yet to respond to their invitation. “Preparations are going on well and we are doing every possible to make sure that we organise a successful event,” he said. Selengia said that his association was not only focused on organising the event but also prepare strong teams that will fly high Tanzania flag at the tournament. He said that both men and women teams are in intensive training in Dar es Salaam under national team coach Shukuru Ally, ready for the event. According to Selengia, members in men’s team are youngsters Fred Masinga and Baraka Mabeyo, while women team has Jonia Jovin and Kuruthumu Jumanne. “The teams are doing fine, all players are in good shape looking forward for a stiff competition ahead,” he said.
