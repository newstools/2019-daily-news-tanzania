TANZANIA Chamber of Commerce, Industrial and Agriculture (TCCIA), in conjunction with Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA), will soon embark on a special programme to donate electronic fiscal devices (EFDs), to Dodoma traders. TCCIA Dodoma Regional Secretary Idd Senge said yesterday that the goal of the programme was to increase the scope of traders using EFDs to improve tax collection. “From the outset, the special programme will target to support at least 1,000 traders. Preparations for the programme are in an advanced stage,” said the TCCIA Dodoma regional secretary. Under the auspices of NBC Bank, special programme beneficiaries will have to open a bank account in NBC Bank in which the facility will be deducting some money every month for EFDs. According to Mr Senge, TCCIA will provide TRA with a list of traders for the scrutiny of traders’ names to identify eligible EFD business operators. It has been revealed that, most traders in the region, who are supposed to use EFDs are yet to start using them due to limited financial possibilities to purchase them. Giving more details, he said NBC Bank would thereafter purchase EFDs and loan approved traders EFDs. Mr Senge noted that after receiving the eligible traders from TRA, NBC Bank would supply EFDs to business operators verified by TRA, saying NBC Bank would put friendly conditions for beneficiaries to refund. “Based on our agreement, the bank will set friendly conditions for beneficiary traders to refund after making profit and deposit money in their bank accounts,” he said. Mr Senge said apart from supporting the traders to get EFDs, the programme would also play a key role in increasing NBC Bank customers.
