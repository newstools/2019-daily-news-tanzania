THE country’s Fair Competition Commission (FCC) has called for more consumers’ protection, particularly against cybercrime. FCC’s registrar Mr Renatus Rutatinisibwa, at the weekend tasked consumer protection bodies to roll out regulations that will govern the protection of consumers against cyber related crimes. “Whilst technology is simplifying life, some are using it to con unsuspecting consumers to their advantage,” explained Mr Rutatinisibwa during the World Consumer Rights Day marked here. The FCC registrar emphasised that many consumers were at the mercy of cyber criminals, warning that such acts would cost the country’s economy if they aren’t resolved. He further called for the removal of what he described as exploitative regulations that are occasionally used in adverts. “We also need to do away with business barriers that will affect the growth of the country’s economy,” he said. In the same vein, the FCC official underscored the importance of putting in place a sound mechanism in resolving disputes pitting one firm against another. The consumer movement marks 15th March with World Consumer Rights Day every year, as a means of raising global awareness about consumer rights and needs. Celebrating the day is a chance to demand that the rights of all consumers are respected and protected, and to protest against market abuses and social injustices which undermine those rights. World Consumer Rights Day was inspired by President John F Kennedy, who sent a special message to the US Congress on March 15 1962, in which he formally addressed the issue of consumer rights. He was the first world leader to do so. The consumer movement first marked that date in 1983 and now uses the day every year to mobilise action on important issues and campaigns.
