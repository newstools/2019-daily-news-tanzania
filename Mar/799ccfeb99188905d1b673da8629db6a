HOME Affairs Deputy Minister Hamad Masauni has directed Traffic Police Commander Fortunatus Muslim to prepare proposals on conducting countrywide road safety awareness sessions in primary schools. The proposal would be distributed to stakeholders, including Puma Energy Tanzania, to seek funding for the implementation of the project to save children’s lives. The deputy minister said this yesterday in Dar es Salaam when launching Puma Energy’s 2019 Road Safety Programme and ahead of the launch of this year’s Road Safety Week at the end of this month. “Launching of this year’s road safety week will be one of its kind,” Mr Masauni assured, but did not go into details. He commended the Puma Energy Tanzania for allocating part of its profits to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), particularly in programmes like that on road safety which aimed at saving the lives of children. Road accidents have been claiming lives of pupils, particularly those studying at schools located close to roads. It normally happens when the pupils cross roads. Mr Masauni also used the platform to criticise traffic police officers who harass motorists. This followed reports via social media, accusing some law enforcers who harass drivers in the city. The Puma Energy Tanzania and an organisation called Amend have collaborated to implement the road safety programme. Earlier, the Amend Programme Officer, Ms Neema Swai, said the programme trains pupils on how to cross roads. She said this prepared them to become good drivers in future.
