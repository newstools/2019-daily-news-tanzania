Speaking yesterday in Dar es Salaam, the Acting Executive Director of TCCIA, Ms Fatuma Hamis said the awards scheduled for April 12, this year aim at attracting more people to invest in agriculture, develop skills and knowledge on agri-business matters. “The awards to be presented for the first time aims at attracting more people and exposing opportunities in the agricultural sector which is the main contributor in the country’s economy,” she said. The awards to be presented in 40 categories will also lead in identifying the most outstanding champions bringing change in the agriculture sector through innovation. “TCCIA is very happy to prepare awards to the agricultural stakeholders---this is the first time and we hope it will stay for more years in order to continue enhancing big change in agriculture for the present and future generations,” she noted.
