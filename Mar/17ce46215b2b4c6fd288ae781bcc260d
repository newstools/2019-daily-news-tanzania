VISA, a global payments technology company, will this week introduce its Visa on mobile app to ease payments for consumers. Visa East Africa’s Director for Merchant Sales and Solutions, Mr Kennedy Luhombo, told journalists in the city during the launch that will be collaborating with 15 banks to roll out the service in the country. He named the banks as CRDB, Barclays, Access Bank Tanzania, Akiba Commercial Bank, Azania Bank Limited among others. “CRDB, NMB and Exim bank will have Visa on mobile enabled on their banking apps to deliver the service to consumers and merchants immediately while the other 12 banks will be implementing the service in the near future,” he said. Visa on mobile is the global payment system which enables consumers to access their funds directly from their bank accounts via mobile banking app to pay merchants, send money to individuals, as well as deposit, or withdraw cash at any Visa agent. Enrolled merchants will receive unique QR code with a Till Number (TN) that customers can scan using smartphone or key enter using a feature phone respectively to make the payments. The funds move directly from the consumer’s bank account into the merchant’s account and provide realtime notification to both parties. After launching, Tanzania will become the fourth country to launch the application after Kenya, Ghana and Rwanda. He explained that there are 30,000 merchant locations and 20,000 agents accepting Visa on mobile across the country. “Both consumers and merchants don’t need to be customers of the same bank or mobile operator because the transaction runs through the Visa network,” he said.
