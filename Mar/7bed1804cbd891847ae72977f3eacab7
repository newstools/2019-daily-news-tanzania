MINISTER for Minerals, Dotto Biteko has directed the Geological Survey of Tanzania (GST), to come up with a national reserve data of precious stones. Mr Biteko gave the directive yesterday during the launch of the GST board under the chairmanship of Prof Justianian Ikingula. He said GST must conduct research on mineral reserve and come up with the national reserve data for proper planning and utilisation. “We must know reserve and resource details, which will make it easier for miners to know in which part of land and what amount of precious stones found,” he said. He also directed the board to ensure they transformed GST into an institution that discharged its duties in the best interests of the nation. “You must transform GST so that it is a fully fledged institution and deliver to public expectations as far as the mineral sector is concerned,” said the minister. Mr Biteko also wanted the board to build GST capacity so that its contribution to the mining sector could be realised. He went on stressing a need for GST to generate revenue, which would facilitate its operations taking keen interest in surveys and researches. As for the surveys and researches in the sector, the minister stressed a need for confidentiality in the findings on reserves submitted to them by private explorers. “All geological researches and surveys will be submitted to you, they are for the best of the nation and when it comes to confidentiality it must be kept,” he added. Moreover, he said, they must use the findings to guide miners and investors so that they could be aware of the quantity and quality and geographical location of the reserves. For his part, Prof Ikingula said GST had to be financially and technologically empowered for increased productivity. He said the focus would be on research on minerals needed for industrialisation to take place.
