Adding, the SOT boss thanked all the athletes who competed during the games saying they have performed well despite preparation challenges they went through prior to the trip. “Other countries have pocketed more medals because they brought many teams which competed in different disciplines and enjoyed full backing from their governments. “This is a lesson for us to send more teams during the next edition of the competition so as to have a chance of claiming more medals,” said Rays.
