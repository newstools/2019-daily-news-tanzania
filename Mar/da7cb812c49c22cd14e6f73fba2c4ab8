ABOUT 100 youths from Dodoma are getting ready to harvest vegetables from their greenhouses after Dodoma City Council Department of Agriculture embarked on a special programme to support such scheme in the area. City Council Agriculture Official, Ms Yustina Munishi, said the goal of the programme was to enable young people in the city to engage in such income generating activities, adding that the programme would also offer them free training on how to manage horticultural activities. “This is to enable young people to grab an opportunity and grow vegetables which have a thriving market in Dodoma City,” she said during a workshop training to the programme beneficiaries. She hinted that the greenhouse practice will overcome some land shortage problems and ensure that they grow the vegetables in confined areas with high yields to improve their incomes and serve them also with food. Ms Munishi said the programme draws young people from two Wards of Nzuguni, Ihumwa and Msalato in Dodoma City, adding that it would also create some employment opportunities to some of them. “The construction of the greenhouse is now complete, though the work to connect them to water network is still ongoing,” she added. The programme is basically the brainchild of the Prime Minister’s Office responsible for Labour, Y outh, Employment and the Disabled, that is part of the national programme aimed at empowering the youth economically.
