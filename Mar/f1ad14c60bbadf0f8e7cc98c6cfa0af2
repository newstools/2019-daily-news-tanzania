MEN have been asked to attend clinic along with their pregnant wives to know their health status and participate in the fight against maternal and child mortality. Speaking during the launch of a campaign named “Jiongeze Tuwavushe Salama” in the city on Wednesday, Dar es Salaam Regional Commissioner (RC), Paul Makonda said it was good for them to accompany their pregnant wives to clinic as it was crucial for their health status. The main focus of the campaign is to save women during and after giving birth and fight against the deaths of children below five years and mothers. He added that the government was working hard to improve infrastructure in public hospitals to ensure quality health services. The RC said the campaign was very crucial for the region and the country at large since statistics showed clearly some women died during child delivery due to poor services. “According to statistics we have reduced maternal and child mortality although the problem is not finished,’’ adding that, the project would help raise public awareness and solve the mortality problem. The RC expressed his gratitude to various development stakeholders, who had been supportive of the government through various programmes that aimed at improving health services in the country. “I am thankful to development partner for their support in the health sector,” he noted. In another development, RC Makonda presented a dummy cheque to Ilala and Kigamboni district commissioners for the construction of district hospitals in Kivule (Ilala) and Kigamboni. Each project is set to cost 1.5bn/- “President John Magufuli has given us 3bn/- for the construction of hospitals in our region. These projects should be completed as soon as possible,’’ he said. For her part, coordinator of the mother and child healthcare in Dar es salaam, Ziada Sellah said the campaign aimed at solving complications that faced women during pregnancy, giving birth and after giving birth.
