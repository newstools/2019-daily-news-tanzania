TANZANIA Law Society (TLS) has endorsed Business Registration and Licensing Agency (Brela) online registration system saying it stimulates investments. The TLS said the new system apart from easing registration work also saves a lot of time. An advocate from TLS, Benedict Ishabakaki said they met with BRELA to review the online registration system a year after it was launched and iron out some challenges arising. “We love the system because it simplifies the work and encourages investment as compared to the initial paper filling system that takes time,” he said. He explained the challenge is how to use the system as many lawyers still do not understand well on how to use the new online system. The two met yesterday to discuss the new online registration system that has been in place since last January. Brela acting Chief Executive Officer Emanuel Kakwezi said it was necessary for them to meet with various stakeholders to discuss the new system and challenges— they started with lawyers. “We want to hear from TLS how they have received the new online system, if it is good, what and where should be corrected in order to improve it,” he said. He said that after TLS they are expecting to meet with other stakeholders namely National Board of Accountants and Auditor (NBAA), Tanzania Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (TCCIA) and the other Institutions that deal with small businesses. He said Brela has so far registered at least 10,000 business names, 5000 companies, 3000 trademarks and provide 106 industrial licences. Currently all BRELA services are provided online in order to reach many traders for short time.
