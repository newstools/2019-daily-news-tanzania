BUSINESS Registrations and Licensing Agency (BRELA) has refuted allegations of bureaucracy in processing applications due to corrupt practices. The Acting Manager, Mr Emmanuel Kakwezi said the allegations were unfounded and that company information submitted to BRELA online need to be complete, accurate and compliant to laws and regulations. “The Agency has been regularly conducting seminars on the use of the new system to a number of stakeholders, including business community, organizations and member of the general public,” he said. However, the agency has been facing various challenges, including clients updating companies’ information without prior due diligence on the status of the company file which creates information inconsistency. He said in the first quarter of 2018, the Agency migrated from paper filling system to what is called Online Registration System (ORS) wherein all services namely new applications or updating previous existed paper records, are to be filed through such a newly introduced system. Again, he added, it was also challenging when clients commissioning persons who are not conversant with Companies Act and Regulations, and unqualified agents filling in forms with errors and gaps. “There was also nonobservation of comments from BRELA when application has been supplemented for correction. Clients also used to repeat the same mistakes or even adding more when filling-in forms after supplement,” he said.
