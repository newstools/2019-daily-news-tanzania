TANZANIA Food and Drugs Authority (TFDA) Manager for Lake Zone Moses Mbambe has warned traders in the Lake Zone against selling counterfeit goods, including fake medicine, cosmetics and food. Speaking during a meeting with stakeholders from the health sector, pharmacists and TFDA officials said there were concerns from members of the public on the presence of many types of fake drugs and cosmetics. Mr Mbambe said it was not a good thing to sell fake drugs and medicine because they had a serious impact on human health. He warned food traders that they were required to have a permit from TFDA. He said TFDA would continue regulating and controlling the importation, exportation, manufacture, advertisement, distribution, sales and use of drugs to ensure safe and quality drugs were available for consumption. He further promised to continue inspecting shops and supermarkets to identify illegal products. Mr Mbambe said there was still importation of fake cosmetics from Mtukula through Lake Victoria especially at night. Mwanza City Council Director Kiomoni Kibamba thanked the fifth phase government for making great strides in improving healthcare through various strategies. He said there had been challenges to their council due to the fact that they were not using effective tools provided by TFDA such as inspection forms. Mr Kibamba congratulated TFDA for protecting and promoting public health by ensuring there were only safe food, drugs, cosmetics and medicine sold to members of the public.
