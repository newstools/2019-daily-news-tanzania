SUMBAWANGA Ward councillor, Mr Cornel Kafumu has commended the fifth phase government for its decision to construct a bridge at River Momoka area which has so far claimed a lot of lives. Mr Kafumu gave the compliments here yesterday before construction of the bridge under the newly launched Tanzania Rural and Urban Roads Agency (TARURA). He said students were forced to cross the river which has no bridge, putting their lives at risk, saying that with the construction of the bridge it has made their movement easy. “Several Katuma and Momoka secondary school students were swept away by water while crossing this river in the past five years, we are thankful for the fifth phase government and TARURA for the bridge” said Mr Kafumu. He said the bridge will give a relief to more than 11,600 Sumbawanga ward residents who will be using the bridge for their social and economic activities which will improve their welfare. Mr Kafumu was quick to alert his colleagues to take good care of the infrastructure which has cost a lot of money in its set up so that it can last long and serve the intended purpose. The sentiments were also shared by Ms Winifrida Mtinda, a resident of the area, who said that women in the area faced a dangerous situation since they could not access health services in time due to lack of a bridge to cross to the other side.
