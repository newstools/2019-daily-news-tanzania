LINDI Municipality will be a beehive of activities as a major business and investment forum for Lindi Region begins today. The three-day forum has been organised by Tanzania Standard Newspapers (TSN) Limited and the Regional Commissionerâ€™s Office to promote business and investment opportunities in the Region to domestic and foreign investors. It will begin with exhibitions by stakeholders in different economic activities in Lindi Region which will run for the entire period of the forum before it is officially opened tomorrow. The forum will draw government and regional leaders, representatives of government institutions dealing with investments as well as members of the business community. The Regional Commissioner, Godfrey Zambi, said preparations for the event billed to be the largest ever in the southern regions of Lindi and Mtwara, were almost complete and they were readily prepared to host high profile visitors for the forum. The region that will host a $ 30 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) project by multinational oil and gas companies, is focused to promote its untapped rich resources in agriculture, fisheries, tourism, and mining for domestic and foreign investments in order to boost growth and development in the region. The Regional Commissioner said the region would like to promote opportunities in agriculture which dominates the economy of the region. The region has lucrative opportunities in agro-processing industries for cashew nut, the leading cash crop, sesame and sunflower, he said. Foreign investors have already been attracted by abundant resources of the region. A cassava processing factory was inaugurated last Friday with capacity to process 60 tonnes of cassava per day. The regional commissioner said Lindi also has ample land for cultivation of food crops such as maize, and peas.
