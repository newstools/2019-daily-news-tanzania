PREPARATIONS for the second ‘Zanzibar International Tourism Show’ have kicked-off with the launch of committees, which will ensure that the exhibitions become successful and fully visited by several participants. The revelation was made here yesterday by the Minister for Information, Tourism, and Antiquities, Mr Mahmoud Thabit Kombo, while inaugurating the committees. Mr Kombo at the same time appealed to the public especially the Show members to work hard to ensure that there was a big turnout, adding that a bigger exhibition was expected in comparison to the previous one that attracted about 400 local and foreign businesspeople in the Island. He said current Steering Committee, Technical, and Communication/Press teams have been formed of about 25 members, chaired by Dr Abdalla Mohamed Juma- Executive Secretary of Z anzibar Tourism Commission, and assisted by a Photographer and businessman, Mr Javed Jaffarji. The Minister said this year’s planned tourism show is scheduled to take place between 26-28 September, and thereafter the organising committees will be engaged in advertising the exhibitions locally and internationally to motivate the public to visit them at the grounds of ‘ Verde Hotel-Azam Luxury Resort & Spa.’ However, he hinted that the budget for this year’s Show has not been revealed. Tourism is Z anzibar’s largest economic sector and essential for the Island’s socio- economic stability. It accounts for between 25 and 27 per cent of its GDP, and accounts for more than 80 per cent of its foreign revenue collections, besides providing the highest private sector employment with more than 60,000 jobs. Last year Zanzibar scooped prestigious the ‘World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC)’ award for the emerging tourism destination market. The last award ceremony was held in Cairo, Egypt.
