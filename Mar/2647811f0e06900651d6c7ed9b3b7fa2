LEADERS KMKM continue to command the Isles top flight league following a comfortable 4-0 win over Kizimbani at Gombani stadium in Pemba on Wednesday. While the win brightened KMKM race to the title, it was quite different to their opponents as the loss plunged them further down on the league table. Kizimbani are bottom-placed with only 10 points. KMKM netted their goals through Mussa Haji who scored a brace and others came Abdulrahman Othman Chinga. The win earned KMKM 58 points. At Amaan stadium in Zanzibar, Jang’ombe Boys suffered a 2-1 loss to Opec. Jang’ombe Boys own goal a minute from the start affected the team’s spirit very much. Yakoub Amour fired a shot into his own net in an attempt to clear the danger and Rashid Seif scored the second goal for Opec in the 80th minute. Jang’ombe Boys scored their consolation goal in the 44th minute through Mohammed Soud. At Mao Dze Tung stadium in Zanzibar, Zimamoto defeated Hard Rock 2-0 with goals from Abuubakar Khamis in the 23rd minute and Hassan Haji three minutes to the stoppage time. New Star forced Isles football giants Malindi to a barren draw in a match held at Finya ground. Malindi have now pocketed 54 points after a draw and are now placed third in the league table. JKU with the same points are now fourth due to inferior goal average. New Star have remained at the 14th position after collected 21 points.
