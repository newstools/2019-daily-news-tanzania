THE Pyrethrum Company of Tanzania has assured growers of the flower at Guse village in Bashnet Ward, Babati District that it will buy all pyrethrum in 2019/2020 season. The Pyrethrum Company Managing Director, Mr John Power, asked farmers to increase productivity and the firm was ready to buy any amount produced. “Keep growing pyrethrum, starting at a small piece of land and you will increase the size as time goes by. “We are assuring you of the market. We have never failed to procure the crop from farmers in Tanzania,” said Mr Power. The firm head office in Iringa. Mr Power was speaking at a public rally that was organised by Babati Rural Legislator, Mr Jitu Son, saying that they would buy the crop between 2,300/- and 3,000/- per kilogramme. The pyrethrum insecticide is a natural chemical. On his part, Mr Son told the villagers that the crop would eventually drive them out of poverty and asked them to increase productivity. “The flower has a ready market and once grown its harvested after every two weeks. Women can benefit a lot if you access loans, get more land and produce more. This will help you,” Mr Son said. Pyrethrum is grown in Mbeya, Njombe, Iringa, Arusha, Manyara and Hai District in Kilimanjaro. In 2015, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) lists Tanzania and Papua New Guinea as the top two producers of pyrethrum in the world. The crop came in the country from Kenya in the 1930s, being cultivated in large estates in the northern highlands-Kilimanjaro, Arusha and Tanga regions.
