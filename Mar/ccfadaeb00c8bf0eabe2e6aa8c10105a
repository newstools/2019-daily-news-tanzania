THE NMB Bank agents can now top up float even beyond working hours of the lender, thanks to newly introduced digital float facility. NMB Head of Transaction Banking, Mr Michael Mungure said over the weekend that with the new product called ‘Floti Fasta’, its 6,800 agents will be loaded with float on instant loan through NMB Mobile up to 5m/- to be repaid for a period of one month. “It’s an interest free product and an agent will only be charged a three per cent processing fee with VAT inclusive upfront,” he said. He added that the product is designed to enable the agents avoid temporary liquidity shortage in order to reach more customers and serve them uninterrupted. “This is the first facility of its kind in the country to ensure that customers are served without a glitch with enhanced cash flow,” he said. The Head of Business Banking, Mr Donatus Richard encouraged the small and medium entrepreneurs to become agents of the bank, since it is another opportunity to generate income. For a person to become NMB agent, she or he needs to have a minimum capital of 2m/-. Mr Ericky Willy, NMB Head of Agency Banking, noted that 80 per cent of the bank’s agents are located in the rural areas, thus the instant float loan would enable them reloading the float without travelling to the bank branches.
