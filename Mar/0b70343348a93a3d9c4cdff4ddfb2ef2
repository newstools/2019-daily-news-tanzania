MINISTER for Natural Resources and Tourism Dr Hamisi Kigwangalla, has challenged Tanzania Forest Service Agency (TFS) workers to manage the country’s forests effectively. He was speaking here over the weekend at the official launching of the TFS board. The minister said that since being appointed the minister for natural resources and tourism, he had discovered that forests and beekeeping were the best resources that the country had and if protected well, would contribute significantly to the national economic growth through foreign currency earnings. He said the country was blessed with abundant natural resources such as rivers, seas and water sources, which Tanzanians have an obligation to protect at any cost. “Today in Cape Town in South Africa, people are sharing water, and it won’t be a long time from now for us to get into that situation if we won’t introduce better future conservation plans,” he said. He advised TFS staff to establish their own forests instead o spending a lot of money on organising tree planting campaigns. On his part, the TFS Chief Executive Officer, Professor Dos Santos Silayo, said Tanzania was doing considerably well on conservation issues in the East African region. The newly elected TFS Board Chairman, Brigadier General Mr Mbaraka Mkeremy, assured the minister that the board would work tirelessly to ensure that the mission of the ministry was met. “I am working with the Tanzania People’s Defence Forces, I know the importance of this ministry, and so let me assure you that we board members are going to deliver,” he said.
