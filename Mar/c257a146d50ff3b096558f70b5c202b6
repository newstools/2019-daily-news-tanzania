WORKS, Transport and Communication Minister, Eng. Isack Kamwelwe said 94 per cent of Tanzanians have access to communication networks in the country. Apart from this, he said in collaboration with the communication stakeholders, the government has also completed a national cyber security strategy. The minister made the announcement here yesterday when opening the Ministry’s, Communication Sector Workers Council under the Chairmanship of Dr Jim Yonazi, who is the ministry’s Acting Permanent Secretary. The minister said so far 530 communication towers have been set up with government subsidy facilitation to mobile phone companies in hard to reach areas and those which are not commercially viable. He stressed on the proper use of communication platforms, whereas the government through the Tanzania Communication Regulatory Authority (TCRA) is using all means possible to deal with cyber-crime. However, he said such efforts will not last long if workers lack commitment and team work for increased productivity and efficiency which will contribute towards national economic development. “Team work and solidarity are something to bank on in terms of good working relations, but also for increased production. Strive for the two so that at the end of the day, we can reach the country’s desired end,” said Eng Kamwelwe He also wanted them to deliberate and discuss in details the ministry (communication sector) budget for 2019/20 so that the public keeps on enjoying the goods of the land. Welcoming the minister, Dr Yonazi vowed that the sector is engaged to ensure communication as well as electronic systems function as required for increased productivity. Dr Yonazi said as per availability of funds, they will send employees for short and long term courses whereas in 2018 /19, almost 20 employees were availed funding for short and long term training within and outside the country.
