EXPORT and Processing Zones Authority (EPZA) has requested Lindi to speed up the process of allocating land for industrial development which is an important strategy in wooing domestic and foreign investors. The authority’s representative, Ms Grace Lemunge said at her presentation at a Business Forum held in Lindi yesterday called upon the regional authority to complete the process of setting aside special processing zones for development of industries. She told participants at the Business Forum organised by the Tanzania Standard News Papers Limited (TSN), publishers of Daily News, Habari Leo and Sport Leo that most developed countries managed to establish strong industrial base after executing the strategy of allocating sufficient land. The establishment of industries in the region was important in adding value to farmers’ products that will guarantee them more income for improved living standards. Moreover, land allocation for industrial development will lead to building strong manufacturing sector which is the heart in the growth of robust economy. She said export of raw goods is currently unacceptable in modern era because it amount to exporting jobs to other countries. For example, she said with increasing manufactured export led products will definitely boost the country’s foreign exchange earnings to benefit the economy and particularly in making the country’s local currency more strong. “Investors in the processing of pulses are guaranteed opportunities provided through the authority’s facilities such as Special Economic Zones [ SEZs] where 80 per cent of the processed products are for exports market,” Ms Lemunge said. She said that investing under SEZ allows owners to exploit huge domestic and foreign markets, better tax incentives and affordable labour costs. Apart from creating more jobs direct and indirect, with increased industries, individual income also increases and improves the living standard of Tanzanians.
