THE Minister for Trade and Industry, Mr Joseph Kakunda has urged both public and private institutions to improve their performance through the Kaizen project so as to achieve economic improvement by 2025. Mr Kakunda was speaking over the weekend during the third Kaizen awards ceremony on successful factories in Kaizen project managed by the Japan International Development Agency (JICA). The project aimed at improving industry and developing techniques for promoting the quality of products produced to increase profitability. “We are aware that this project is expected to be completed next year. We want to continue implementing it in the country to increase changes in the workplaces,” the minister said. He stressed that all private and public institutions should implement the said projects since they contribute in managing money, time and resources as well as improving record keeping and documentation. The minister said the Kaizen Tanzania Unit (TKU) will be expanded to reach many traders and industries, promote productivity and enhance productivity of their products and that it will bring positive economic and industrial results. “Kaizen is not just for the factories and traders, we want the government institutions to apply Sasambua, SET, Safisha, Sanifisha and Shikilia systems (5S-KAIZEN) in implementing various projects,” he explained. According to Kakunda, the institutions that apply the system includes commercial banks, Vocational Education and Training Authority (VETA), Occupational Safety and Health Authority (OSHA), Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO), Tanzania Industrial Research and Development Organisation (TIRDO), Tanzania Food and Drug Authority (TFDA), Weight and Measurements Agency (WMA) and Business Registration and Licensing Agency (BRELA). Japan’s Ambassador to Tanzania, Mr Shinichi Goto, said that the projects will help Tanzania to achieve its commitment of having a strong central economy by 20125 and to achieve Millennium Goals.
