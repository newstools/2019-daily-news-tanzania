THE government, through the Ministry for Agriculture, has announced that it is mounting a special operation to identify traders, who sell fake and substandard agricultural inputs to farmers across the country. Minister for Agriculture, Japhet Hasunga said yesterday that the supply of fake and substandard agricultural inputs occasioned losses not only to farmers, but also to the government in general. The minister was speaking to Director for African Zone of the International Atomic Energy, Prof Shaukat Abdulrazak, who he met in Dodoma yesterday to discuss various agricultural issues. “We have come up with a strategy to identify dealers in fake and substandard agricultural inputs, who have been a stumbling-block to agricultural development,” he said. He said Tanzania was among the many countries that were victims of fake seeds and that the government had, therefore, decided to deal with the problem. “We have decided to come up with a strategy that will help us solve this problem,” he noted. According to him, the government has decided to employ a technology in farming that will solve the problem of existing fake and substandard agricultural inputs. “It is obvious that farmers have been investing a lot in agriculture, but end up receiving fake seeds and fertilisers from dishonest suppliers. We are going to get to the bottom of this problem so that our people should benefit from the sector,” he insisted. For his part, Prof Abdulrazak expressed his agency’s commitment to ensuring the improvement of agricultural sector in the country, saying it would continue cooperating with the responsible authorities to boost agriculture in the country.
