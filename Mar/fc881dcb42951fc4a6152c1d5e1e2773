TANESCO is set to double power supply in Kigamboni this month after the completion of 2.5 million US dollars project that adds a new transmission line. The project, under Tanzania energy development and access expansion project (TADEP) adds a second 132Kv transmission line from Kurasini to Kigamboni Substation and later expected to be extended to Dege Beach Substation. TANESCO Chairman Eng Alexander Kyaruzi said that the project if well supervised will help Kigamboni residents to get rid of unstable power services which is a panacea for industrial economy. “The project has reached a good stage…and will double and improve power sustainability in Kigamboni. “The contractor is at the last stage of connecting transmission line between the two stations,” Eng Kyaruzi who is a senior lecturer said yesterday. The TANESCO Board, led by Eng Kyaruzi, was touring the project to determine the development of the project. The chair was pleased with the stage of the project reached that is mainly financed by the World Bank. However, Eng Kyaruzi said TANESCO should supervise and make sure that the project improve power availability in the area since ‘ wananchi’ want quality and nonerratic electricity supply. TANESCO’s Senior Project Manager Eng Emanuel Manirabona prior to the visiting board members said the construction has reached 92 per cent and will be completed in this month. Eng Manirabona said the transmission lines will later cross the ocean to Dege Beach Substation supplying 33Kv and will stabilise power supply in that area. Other improvements will be connecting what is referred technically as ring circuit which will facilitate alternating power supply from one substation to another to curb unnecessary frequent power cuts in the commercial city according to Eng Manirabona.
