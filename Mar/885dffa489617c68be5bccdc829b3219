DEPUTY Vice Chairman of the ruling CCM, Philip Mangula, has raised a red flag against party officials who have started to express their intentions to vie for parliamentary positions in the 2020 General Election. He said the party had its own rules and regulations which should be strictly followed by all members regardless of their positions or titles within the ruling party. “The truth is that many people within the party have been referring to me as ‘files watchman,’ but this is not my official name but they gave me the name because of strictly abiding by party rules without caring about the position a member holds,’’ he explained. Mr Mangula was speaking in Mpwapwa District in Dodoma Region, when receiving over 400 new members of the party’s Youth Wing, UVCCM, at an occasion where he directed party leaders to bank on the new members’ potentiality, saying they were part of the party’s workforce. The new members are from Mpwapwa Teachers College. “I am happy as we receive the young energetic members who now become part of the workforce of the party ahead of the 2020 General Election. Dodoma Regional party chairman, Godwin Mkanwa commended party leaders in Mpwapwa District for addressing the residents’ problem, led by District Commissioner Jabir Shekimweri. “We commend the District Commissioner for maintaining law and order in the district and we believe that the development we see now has been facilitated by his exemplary leadership,” he remarked. The CCM chairman further requested Kibakwe lawmaker, Mr George Simbachawene, to ensure that in the 2019/ 2020 budget, funds were allocated for the Kongwa-Kibakwe to Mpwapwa road. Mpwapwa District Party Chairman, George Chigwie, said district officials were continuing to implement the party manifesto and all the pledges that were made by the national party chairman, Dr John Magufuli.
