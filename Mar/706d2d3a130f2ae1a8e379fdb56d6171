WILD animals’ population is reportedly increasing within IKona Wildlife Management Area (WMA) in Serengeti District, thanks to the ongoing conservation efforts. “Presently Ikona WMA has many different wild animals, let us protect them” said WMA Chairman, Mr Elias Chama. Mr Chama made the remark recently, while presiding over a training wind up for 25 Village Game Scouts of the WMA that was organised as a special antipoaching training in Western Serengeti. The two week-anti-poaching training was organised by Pasiansi Wildlife Training Institute (PWTI) in collaboration with F rankfurt Zoological Society (F ZS) as part of efforts to enhance conservation efforts of the wild animals in Western Serengeti. WMA that covers about 242.3 square kilometers is home to several tourism companies, including Singita Grumeti which operates world class lodges in Western Serengeti. It also provides sanctuary beautiful animals, which includes elephants, buffalo, giraffes, wildebeest and zebras amongst others. Meanwhile, part of the WMA’s revenue which goes up to 3bn/- annually is directed to finance local communities’ development projects in its neighbourhood villages. Mr Chama singled the construction of new Secondary School at Nyichoka village as one of the areas where WMA ploughs back in the communities in its Social Corporate Responsibilities (SCR). “WMA has been very beneficial to our villages. F or example apart from building a Dispensary at Nyichoka village, they are building a new Secondary School in the same village. The Secondary School is now admitting F orm One students,” he pointed out. Other villages benefiting from the significant WMA’s revenue are Robanda, Park Nyogoti, Natta- Mbiso and Makundusi.
