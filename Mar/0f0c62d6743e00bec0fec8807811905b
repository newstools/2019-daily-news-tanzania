AIR Tanzania Corporation Limited (ATCL) has strongly refuted a rumour that started circulating yesterday that the newly acquired Airbus 220- 300 is about to be sold to Kenya Airways. Speaking to the ‘Daily News’ yesterday, ATCL spokesman Josephat Kagirwa said the aircraft was hired in Kenya on Thursday for business purposes and returned to Dar es Salaam the same day. “The rumour is a blatant lie that members of the public should ignore. The plane flew to Nairobi for business purposes on Thursday and it flew back to Dar es Salaam the same day after accomplishing its mission,” Mr Kagirwa noted. According to the ATCL spokesperson, yesterday the aircraft carried out its routine operations from Dar es Salaam. “If you came today (yesterday) during the morning at the airport you could see the plane,” he said. However, the spokesperson could not give details on who had hired it, maintaining that ATCL would issue an official statement on the matter anytime. Sources outside ATCL management claimed that the aircraft was leased to Airbus Company and Kenya Airways for marketing purposes as ATCL was the only airline in Africa operating such a model of plane. “Since Airbus didn’t want to bring Airbus 220-300 from outside Africa to Nairobi for marketing, the firm resorted to hire the aircraft from ATCL, which after the event flew back the same day (Thursday),” the source claimed. However, such claims could not be independently verified. The rumour that started circulating claimed that the aircraft was about to be sold to Kenya Airways after ATCL had failed to secure permits for the plane to land in foreign destinations. It claims the plane was taken to Nairobi to be inspected by Kenya Airways officials. Air Tanzania became the latest member of Airbus aircraft operators, and the fifth airline after Swiss, Air Baltic, Korean Air and Delta to take delivery of the former Bombardier aircraft
