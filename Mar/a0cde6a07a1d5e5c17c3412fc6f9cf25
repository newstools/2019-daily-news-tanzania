ARUSHA’s hopes to enter the next season’s Mainland Premier League have been dashed after the region’s only potential team, Arusha United, announced to pull out of the First Division League. The shocking sporting news was confirmed here on Thursday, just few days after the controversial match which took place in Moshi, where the Arusha United were beaten 1-0 by hosts Polisi Tanzania in a fiercely skirmished encounter. Arusha United’s Executive Officer, Otte Beda said in a press meeting here that, the team’s board of directors sat to discuss the last weekend’s chaos in Moshi and concluded that they no longer want to continue with the FDL because all the rough moves against the team seem to be ‘ pre-arranged.’ The Tanzania Football Federation as well as the FDL Board should be blamed for the ongoing fracas in the league and that unless other authorities intervene, the games will continue to be spiked. Beda listed series of alleged chaos including the last weekend match in Moshi; previous game between Arusha United and Rhino Rangers in Tabora; as well as the match between Arusha United and Transit Camp, which was played in Dar es Salaam. Following the last defeat in Moshi, Arusha United dropped from third to fifth slot, with 28 points. According to the fixtures, Arusha United FC are due to face Pamba FC in Mwanza on April 4th this year. Polisi Tanzania are now second with 32 points, just a point below leaders, Geita Gold, who sit top on 33 points. Pamba FC of Mwanza, who beat Geita 2-0 last weekend, are now on the third position with 29 points tied with fourth-placed Boma FC of Mbeya but the former have superior goal difference. Green Warriors of Dar es Salaam are on sixth position with 25 points. FDL matches have just taken a fortnight hiatus to pave way for African Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier matches and Azam Sports Federation Cup both taking place from March 28th to April 2nd this year.
