POLISI Tanzania FC believe they have assembled enough weapons to win their remaining five games of the First Division League (FDL), to stand a chance of stepping into the Mainland Premier League next season. Currently, the Moshi based side sit second in the tricky FDL, group B table with 32 points, one point behind leaders Geita Gold FC who have pocketed 33 points after playing 17 games. However, out of the five matches, Polisi Tanzania FC will play three away encounters against Rhino Rangers, Mgambo Shooting and Green Warriors before entertaining Arusha FC and Boma FC respectively. Speaking to the ‘Daily News’ yesterday, the team’s Communication Officer Frank Geoffrey said they have intensified training to win all five remaining matches. “Remember we have won six back to back home and away FDL ties and we are in a positive form both mentally and physically,” he said. He further said they aim to collect six points in Tabora against Rhino Rangers and Mgambo Shooting before facing the other three fixtures. “The team is enjoying good support from our boss, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Simon Sirro, hence the only reward to give him is by winning the top flight league ticket for next season,” Geoffrey said.
