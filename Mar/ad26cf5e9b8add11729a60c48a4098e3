TARIME Town Council is scheduled to start construction of an 8 billion shillings worth market which is expected to transform the old town in Mara Region into a modern trading hub. “This is going to be a modern market that will change Tarime town and the lots of money that it will help to generate will also transform Tarime town in different ways,” the Tarime Town Council Director, Mr Elias Ntiruhungwa, said here during a recent briefing session. Mr Ntiruhungwa thanked President Magufuli’s administration for financing the strategic project which will help to boost the council’s revenue upon completion. “We are earnestly thanking our president for this project. It will help to boost our revenue and the increased income will help us to provide better services like education, health and water supply,” the town director said. He said already, the council had announced a tender for the work on the new market, but emphatically pointed out that only a competent would be assigned for it. Mr Ntiruhungwa said traders operating in the old market that will be demolished to pave way construction of the new market have welcomed the project, following fruitful meetings the council held with them and other key stakeholders. “We also thank Tarime town traders for backing construction of the new market and we are prepared to accommodate them during the construction period. No trader will be left without a trading place”, Mr Ntiruhungwa said. The market project makes Tarime Town Council one of the councils that are benefitting from multibillion strategic projects being funded by the government in order to speed up social and economic development.
