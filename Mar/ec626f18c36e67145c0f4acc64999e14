NORTH Mara Gold Mine (NMGM) has allocated 800m/- for the construction of a Vocational Training Centre (VTC) to train residents from villages located near the mining company. The decision made by the mining company to construct the technical college is part of the initiatives of honouring its agreements with the local villages located adjacent to the mining firm. “We will finance construction of the VTC this year, and 800 m/- is available for the project,” North Mara Gold Mine Sustainable Communities Manager, Mr Richard Ojendo told the ‘Daily News’ over the phone yesterday. Mr Ojendo said the mine will start disbursing the funds as soon as Tarime District Council will be ready to execute the project. Tarime District Council Executive Director, Mr Apoo Castro Tindwa said location for the new VTC will be at Nyabichune village. Nyabichune is one of the areas in Nyamongo where local communities surrounding the gold mine live. “The drawings of the VTC are ready and the location is set at Nyabichune,” the director said when reached for comment. Implementation of the project will commence soon, he added and that it is set to become the first modern VTC in the region. According to Mr Apoo, the VTC will among other things offer mining courses to young men and women upon completion. Besides North Mara Gold Mine, the villages around the gold mine have a large number of small gold mines run by artisanal miners but mostly using lowtechnology. Construction of the VTC is expected to create technical training opportunities for a significant number of young men and women completing primary and secondary education in the district council and perhaps other parts of the region.
