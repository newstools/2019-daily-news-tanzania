THE Embassy of Switzerland to Tanzania has early today extended a grant of 18bn/- to three local Civil Society Organizations (CSO) to enhance transparency and accountability in the country. The money has been given to the Foundation of Civil Society (FCS), Policy Forum and Twaweza in their next four years implementation activities. Speaking during the signing ceremony, the Ambassador of Switzerland to Tanzania, Florence Mattli, said the grant will support the government of Tanzania to increase its accountability and efficiency of policies and measures through the CSOs. Presiding over, the Executive Director of Twaweza, Aidan Eyakuze said the donation will help the organizations to further strengthen their relations with the government. “Most of these CSOs have great ideas, but aren’t financially stable to execute their activities, with this money we can reach out to the public and enable them to carry out their endeavours,” he added.
