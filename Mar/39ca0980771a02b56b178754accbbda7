NATIONAL youth’s golf team members Likuli Juma, Michael Richard, Aliraza Hussein and Garv Singh endured tough challenge in the opening round of All-Africa J unior Golf Challenge in Gaborone on Tuesday to finish 12th in the field of 13 countries. The opening round of the four-round competition at the Phakalane Golf Estate Hotel Resort in Gaborone, saw the national youth team carding 259 shots to end joint 12th placed in the field of 13 countries. Report from Botswana said that the Tanzanian youngsters fought brilliantly against the tricky course, but found it hard when they tied by Gabon who also returned the same score. The prestigious annual boys and girls team event is played over four days, with 18 holes per day. The best gross three scores out of four will count for the day. Tanzania like many participating teams entered only boys’ team at the event. Junior team was making their second appearance since returning to the continental level competition in the event held last year in Morocco. Lack of course acclimatisation dealt a team a big blow as they arrived in Botswana a day before the tee off, thus making it difficult for them to quick adapt the course. Though, Tanzania Golf Union (TGU) competition secretary Enock Magile who accompanied the team there, said he has high hopes the boys will improve after getting used to the strange course. Two youths are making their debut to the international competition while two others are making their second appearance, according to Magile. The best from East African Community (EAC) was Uganda who had a flying start to finish second behind the defending champions and overnight leaders South Africa. Ugandan youth carded aggregate 222 strokes which is 22 strokes behind the top leaders who got their title defence off to a solid start with 16 under in the opening round with 200 gross strokes.
