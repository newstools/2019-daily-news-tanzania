THE Arusha-based Pan African Court has doubled its judicial production and is optimistic that it will do better this year. That was recently revealed here by the President of the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights, Justice Sylvain Ore in a New Year dinner with the Court’s staff, hinting that the institution has demonstrated professionalism, perseverance and teamspirit to achieve the results. In reference he further pointed out that: “Our major achievement in 2018 was judicial productivity, which almost doubled over the past two years.” However, he reminded the 80-plus staff that the mission of the Court was to render justice to Africans and the continent’s people whose rights are being violated, adding that: “We can be proud to have also rendered justice to a greater extent in 2018. As we have already begun 2019, the Court should stay focused on the vision of strengthening the culture of human rights in Africa.” Focusing on the ongoing reforms at the African Union (AU) initiated under the guidance of the immediate past chairperson, President Paul Kagame of Rwanda, Justice Ore said the Court should be a model for internal reforms and an efficient icon for other institutions and the citizens in the continent. The African Court that was established by the African Charter, and came into operation initially in November 2006 in Addis Ababa and a year later resumed permanent Seat in Arusha, has so far finalised 48 cases, and still 135 ones pending. The first four years of the Court’s operations were dedicated mainly to staff recruitments and creating the Rules of the Court that made it capable to render the first Judgment early this year. So far 30 African countries have ratified the protocol establishing the Court, however, only eight of them namely Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, The Gambia, Ghana, Malawi, Tunisia and host Tanzania have made the declaration to allow individuals and NGOs to access the Court directly.
