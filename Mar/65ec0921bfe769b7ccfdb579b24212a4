THE Archbishop of Dar es Salaam, Cardinal Polycarp Pengo, yesterday urged education institutions in the country to offer education that aims at inculcating ethical conduct in students instead of interfering in their faith and other privacy issues. Speaking during the launch of the Council Chamber for St Joseph University in Tanzania (SJUIT), Cardinal Pengo said education institutions under the Catholic Church focused on offering education, which also shaped and prepared students morally. “Tanzania is passing through a period where the relevance of religion and education are questioned. No community in this country can claim to be purely belonging to a given religious group, but mixed up. People should not fear or think that universities owned and run by the Catholic Church aim at converting students into Catholics,” he insisted. SJUIT Chancellor, Fr Arul Raj, told council members that the main aim of the university was to bring excellence in education with employable skills especially in engineering and be part of the country’s history and make students study science, mathematics and technology effectively and productively. SUJIT Acting Vice-Chancellor, Prof Innocent Ngalinda, said council members, who had been selected, were not picked on the basis of faith or religion based background. He said the new members would serve the council for three years
