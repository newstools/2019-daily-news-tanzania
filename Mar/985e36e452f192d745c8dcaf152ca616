TANZANIA has confirmed to send a team in Zimbabwe, the venue of the Africa region T20 Women Cricket qualifiers to be staged in Harare from May 5 to 13 this year. The weeklong qualifiers will be held at Harare Sports Club, Old Hararians and Takashinga. Tanzania joins eight other teams including hosts Zimbabwe, to fight for two slots to make it to the World T20 Cricket finals. Women T20 World Cup finals will be held in Australia. Others are Nigeria, Namibia, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda and Mozambique. Reports added that Tanzania, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda and Sierra Leone will also take part in the double qualifiers. The qualifiers in Zimbabwe will be played on a T20 format for the 2020 World Cup, but will also double as qualifiers for the 50-over World Cup in 2020. The regional qualifier which is named the ICC Women Twenty20 World Cup Africa Qualifier is a pathway to the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup Qualifier and ultimately the ICC Women T20 World Cup. Winners of the Africa qualifier will proceed to take part in the global qualification tournament where they stand an opportunity to make it to next year’s ICC. The tournament, which will feature nine teams namely Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Rwanda, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Uganda and Zimbabwe, will be played from 3 to 13 May. Namibia staged the last edition of ICC Women Twenty20 World Cup Africa Qualifier in 2017 with Zimbabwe missing out on the ticket to the global qualifier after suffering a threewicket loss to Uganda in the final played at the Wanderers Cricket Ground in Windhoek. Last year, Uganda also defeated Zimbabwe by seven runs in the final of the Women’s T20 Challenge held at Takashinga Cricket Club in Harare. Zimbabwe will however, be hoping to atone for the disappointment by winning the ICC Women Twenty20 World Cup Africa Qualifier at home soil.
