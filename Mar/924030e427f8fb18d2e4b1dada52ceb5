AFTER taking a five years hiatus, the annual Sokoine Memorial Marathon returns this year but instead of taking place in Monduli District as usual, the 21 kilometres event moves into Arusha City on Saturday April 6th, 2019. The Chairman of the Sokoine Memorial Foundation Committee, Lembris Kipuyo stated here during a press conference that, the Half-Marathon is being organised in association with the family of the late Edward Moringe Sokoine, the former Prime Minister who died in road accident back in 1984. “There will also be special memorial mass in reminiscence of the late Sokoine to be held at the former Premier’s residence in Monduli Juu on April 12th this year, but a week before the church oriented event, the committee will organise the Sokoine Memorial Marathon in Arusha City. The last time that the Sokoine race took place was back in 2014. The organizers did not explain why the event went underground for over four years before resuming this April. It is also expected that the Prime Minister, Kassim Majaliwa will grace the Sokoine Marathon. According to Alfredo Shahanga, the race will be flagged off at Clock Tower junction, billed to be the centre of Africa. From Clock-Tower, the athletes are to run along the main Sokoine Road all the way to Ngarenaro, then divert at Nairobi Corner junction moving up along Nairobi Villa Road towards Arusha Technical Centre. Later they will turn left entering onto the Namanga Road then down to Kisongo area and race back to the city, ending up at the Sheikh Amri Abeid Memorial Stadium along Col Middleton Road. Other events to colour the race include the ‘Fun Run,’ covering 5 kilometres and the children race of 2 kilometres. Registration for all events have started at the city stadium.
