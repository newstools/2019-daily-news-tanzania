THE Parliamentary Public Investment Committee (PIC) has shown satisfaction over the investment in the projects aiming at modernising the Dar es Salaam port. The Dar es Salaam Maritime Gateway Project (DMGP) has already shown good results as it has upgraded its performance effectively and efficiently, evidently shown through the increase of revenue collected and providing dividend to the government. The first phase that involves deepening of berth number one to seven to enable large vessels to dock has now reached 52 per cent whereas birth one is already operational and has proven to be effective in reducing traffic. PIC Chairman Dr Raphael Chegeni said yesterday that the visit has given light on how well the project is being implemented. “Today we have witnessed the progress done on DMGP including berth one, something that has already shown results as it has added efficiency and reduced dwell time at the port,” he said. This has also led to the increase of port revenue enabling them to offer dividend to the government, Dr Chegeni said. “Last year the port provided 254m/- as dividend to the government. We expect the amount to increase this year,” he said. Adding that, the port is another important gateway to the country that if used properly it will generate more income. The port modernisation expects to cost some 345 million US dollars from the World Bank, 64 million US dollars from TPA and 12 million US dollars from United States (DFID). The port, the largest in the country, faces a number of challenges to limit its competitiveness with its peers in the East and Southern Africa. Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA) Director General Eng Deusdedit Kakoko said that DMGP is on track despite facing some challenges. The modernisation of Ro- Ro berth is expected to be complete by June to double its handling capacity to 6000 cars. The first phase of the project is expected to be complete by 2020 and the entire project to be complete by 2025.
