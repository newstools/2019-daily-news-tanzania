ALL Muslim pilgrims intending to go for this year’s Hajj will be fingerprinted in the country before proceeding for the holy journey, to overcome inconveniences which have been occurring in the past. Speaking to the media in Dar es Salaam yesterday, the Hajj Coordinator, Sheikh Mussa Hemed, said previously, the pilgrims went through the procedure on entry to Saudi Arabia. “The former system caused a lot of inconveniences for pilgrims around the world upon arrival at Jeddah and Madina airports. “Under the new system, pilgrims are required to complete all necessary requirements for the trip early,” said Sheikh Hemed, who is also the Secretary of Mufti at a campaign to launch the preparations of Hajj. He observed that the process will be conducted by representatives from Saudi Arabia. Sheikh Hemed also called upon the responsible transportation companies to follow up on the pilgrim’s passports early, considering that the process is done electronically to overcome any problems at later stages. According to him, seventeen institutions applied and have been approved for the task. However, they will be required to finalise all the necessary processes on time. He identified them as including the payment of fees for each institution and Hajj fee for this year. “If a company fails to complete the processes before April 10, 2019, it will be removed from the list,” he noted.
