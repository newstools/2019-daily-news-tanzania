THE Ministry of Minerals has directed North Mara Gold Mine to contain leakages of seepage from penetrating to local communities’ residential areas and nearby water sources by March 30 this year. Failure to do that the gold mine will be closed, the minister, Doto Biteko warned when he made a long day visit to the mine on Tuesday. “We want leakages of water from the gold mine to people’s residential areas to end as soon as possible. The deadline is March 30 and if nothing will happen by that deadline, the government will not hesitate to close the mine,” he stated emphatically. Mr Biteko said the government cannot tolerate leakages of water containing harmful substances getting out of the mine and putting the health of local communities at risk. “To us a life of a single Tanzanian is fundamental. We better close the mine,” the minister who was accompanied by several officials including Mara Regional Commissioner (RC), Adam Malima , said. He added that the government’s environment experts had already directed the gold mine on what should be done to contain the seepage, he said. North Mara is one of the largest gold mines operated by Acacia Mining in the country. Local communities have been blaming the gold mine for allegedly polluting water sources due to mismanagement of seepage for years now. In September last year, President John Magufuli ordered the National Environment Management Council (NEMC) to conduct a fresh investigation on the alleged contamination caused by the gold mine to water sources including River Tigithe. The Head of State issued the order when he stopped over in the villages around North Mara Gold Mine when he was in the gold rich district for a long week working visit.
