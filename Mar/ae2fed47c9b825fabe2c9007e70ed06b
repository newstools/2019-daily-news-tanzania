NORTH Mara Gold Mine yesterday said it had issued cheques amounting to 400m/- in compensation of 21 villagers. However, the turn up appears to be small with the majority of villagers reportedly objecting to the amount of money calculated, saying “it is too little for them to receive it as compensation”. “So far, 21 villagers have collected 400m/-, but doors are open for others to come and collect their cheques, “ North Mara Gold Mine Acting General Manager Richard Ojendo told the ‘Daily News’ on Tuesday. “These are out of 134 villagers on the list of those to be compensated,” Mr Ojendo said in a brief telephone interview. Minister for Minerals Doto Biteko directed all 134 villagers to go for their cheques when he toured of the mine and surrounding villages last week. Mr Ojendo insisted that there would be no compensation for speculators, who had built small and big houses aiming heft compensation from the giant mining company. President John Magufuli made a stopover in Nyamongo when he visited Mara Region in September last year and directed the Ministry of Minerals, district and regional leaders to address the compensation issue as soon as possible. But President Magufuli warned that speculators shouldn’t be compensated, instead he wanted all those entitled to compensation to be paid without delay. Many houses called “tegesha” are still seen in the areas around the goldmine to date. According to Mr Ojendo, those to be paid will need to shift from the areas located close to mining activities. “Some have already moved and others will need to move after compensation for land, buildings and crops,” Mr Ojendo, who is also the goldmine’s sustainable manager, said at a press briefing when he was announcing the mine’s latest compensation phase early this month.
