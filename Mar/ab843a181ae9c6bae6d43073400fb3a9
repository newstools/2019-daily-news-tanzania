TANZANIA Investment Centre (TIC) has called on the need for better mechanism of resolving tax claims between investors and the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) in order to create win win situation. The TIC Executive Director Geoffrey Mwambe made the call here after hearing the tax row between the Moshi based Kilimanjaro Manufacturers Company and TRA amounting to 2.8bn/-that led to the factory closure some six years ago. “The government’s goal is to make sure each side benefits, TRA when you close this factory you do not get taxes because an investor is not operating, ultimately we all lose, to end this matter with reconciliation,” he said. He also said there was need for a team of experts to investigate the tax matter and that the manufacturer should be allowed to continue with production while the investigation process is proceeding. “It is good for TRA to set friendly environment and you are responsible for collecting taxes by convincing investors, but the act of putting obstacles deny the government the much needed revenue,” he said. Mr Mwambe expressed dissatisfaction with some TRA officials who evaluate investor huge taxes which cannot be paid but also asked them to go for reconciliation on tax rows instead of suspending production. The Director General of Kilimanjaro Manufacturers Company, the maker of spirits, Mr Aloyce Kimaro, said that TRA has never engaged them in anyway while investigating the tax saga. Mr Kimaro said he doesn’t know the person allegedly to have brought the raw materials for the production of alcohol known as ‘Mokwiri’ as production was put on hold for more than six years. TRA Kilimanjaro Regional Manager, Mr Alpherio Kissima said they have followed legal procedures and that the investigation is completed showing that the investor is owed 2.8bn/-. Moshi District Commissioner (DC), Mr Kippi Warioba said the district authority would ensure that TRA and the investor meet to resolve the matter amicably
