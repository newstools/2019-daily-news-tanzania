THE African Development Bank (AfDB) has promised to continue cooperating with Tanzania in implementing various development projects, including transport infrastructure, electricity and airport construction. This was stated by the Minister for Finance and Planning, Dr Philip Mpango after meeting and holding talks with the President of AfDB, Dr Akinwumi Adesina during a meeting which brought together finance ministers from East African countries held in Abijan, Ivory Coast. Dr Mpango, who is also AfDB governor, affirmed that the bank’s president has agreed to President Magufuli’s request of granting Tanzania soft loans to enable commencement of Msalato airport construction in Dodoma. “The bank has been of great help, and there are plenty of sectors that the bank’s president has agreed to collaborate with in our country,” commented Dr Mpango. He added that Dr Adesina has agreed to support development efforts put in by the government. He further requested the bank to speed up project preparations that are expected to be initiated this year, which include the construction of Msalato airport estimated to cost 200 US million dollars, and roads across Dodoma City estimated to cost 180 million US dollars. Other projects include Kakono electricity generation project (350 million US dollars) and Bagamoyo-Tanga/Lungalunga-Mombasa-Malindi road construction project (158.2 million US dollars). The bank has also promised to support the country in acquiring soft loans to be able to start implementing the projects on time. AfDB also promised to ink the 256 million US dollars contract of the Kabingo-Kasulu-Manyovu (260km) road construction early this March. On the other hand, Finance Ministers from the East African countries who attended the meeting promised the bank’s president that they will continue to support the bank’s goal of increasing capital to enable member countries to acquire soft loans for implementing development projects.
