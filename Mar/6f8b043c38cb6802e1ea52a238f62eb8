A government chemist, Mr Fidelis Segumba (40), has told the High Court here that he conducted DNA tests on several exhibits which he received from the Kagera Regional Crimes Officer (RCO), and found blood stains that matched those of accused persons who are facing a murder charge. Mr Segumba, who testified as PW (Public Witness) 9 also tendered as an exhibit, a Maasai sword and two machetes, which the prosecution claimed were used in the mysterious killings of more than 20 people. The killings, most of the victims of which had their throats cut, and which caused much panic amongst Kagera Region residents, were linked to superstitious beliefs. Three prisoners who are currently serving life imprisonment for burning a Roman Catholic church at Kanazi, in Bukoba Rural District, are facing a murder case No 66/2017 for the murder of four people. The convicts were identified as Aliyu Dauda Hassan (36) from Kemondo, in Bukoba Rural District, Rashid Mzee Athuman (29), and Ngesela Keya Ismail (24) both from Rwamishenye Ward in Bukoba Municipality. Mr John Kessy, the former OC CID for Bukoba, on the other hand, told the court that on November 1, 2015, four people, three males and a female, were murdered on a single night. He told the court that at around 11.30 o’clock at night, he received a phone call and immediately rushed to Ekigoma Hamlet in Katoma Ward, about 15 kilometres from Bukoba town and found two bodies–of a male and a female lying in a pool of blood. According to Mr Kessy, who testified as PW 10, as detectives were examining the bodies, he received another call and rushed to the nearby Akilembo Hamlet where he found two more bodies. He identified the deceased as Kaijage John, Anastela Paschal, Emmanuel Joseph and Evodius Aloys, all residents of Katoma Ward, in Bukoba Rural District.
