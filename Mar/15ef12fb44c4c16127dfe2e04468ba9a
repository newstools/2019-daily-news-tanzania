ENERGY Minister Dr Medard Kalemani says all villages in Chamwino District will be connected with electricity by June this year under the Rural Energy Agency (REA) Rural Electrification Programme. The Minister made the promise here over the weekend during his visit to Mpwayungu village in Mtera, Chamwino District and urged all the families to try to become connected with electricity, once the service is brought in their midst. “Residents in rural areas can be connected with electricity through REA programme at affordable cost of only 27,000/-,” pointed out the Minister, during the event to switch on the power for the first time at Mpwayungu Primary School. The event also saw the Minister handing over 280 UMETA electric devices to residents of Mpwayungu village in Mtera, Chamwino District. UMETA (Kiswahili abbreviation for readymade electricity) serves as a main switch in a house with low level of electricity uses. According to the Minister, the UMETA device has the capacity to switch on a light, cooker, clothes iron, TV and radio. Dr Kalemani also directed a contractor, A to Z contractors, who is carrying out the project to supply electricity in Mpwayungu and open up a sub office in the village to facilitate electricity connection in the areas. “Residents can even start paying in installation to the contractor’s sub office so that when the payment totals 27,000/-, the electricity should be supplied to their households,” directed the Minister. On his side, Mtera Member of Parliament (MP), Mr Livingstone Lusinde, expressed gratitude to the government for the electricity supply in the village, saying it will stimulate economic growth and motivate the villagers to start several businesses and raise their incomes. “I appeal to the youth to open Saloons and small food processing industries to create job opportunities for themselves and raise their incomes. Dodoma has now created a good number of opportunities for residents,” said the Mtera MP.
