THE Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO), has resolved to reach all people with special needs across the country to equip them with knowledge on their operations. The initiative was confirmed by Tanesco Manager for the Lake Zone, Eng Macline Mbonile here on Wednesday during a seminar organised for people with hearing disabilities to sensitize them on the duties and responsibilities undertaken by the company. According to Eng Mbonile who represented the Tanesco Managing Director, Dr Tito Mwinuka, the company resolved to reach members with special needs to make sure that nobody was left out as the entity works hard to disseminate enough information to all power consumers on its undertakings, achievements and challenges it was facing. “We have been conducting sensitisation campaigns to the rest of the community on activities undertaken by our entity, but we are not certain whether all people with special needs are aware of what we are doing, hence this workshop,” he said. Eng Mbonile challenged people with special needs should participate in such workshops will and later transfer the acquired knowledge to their colleagues since it was crucial for all to be involved in the whole sensitization task. Opening the workshop, the Ilemela District Commissioner (DC), Dr Severin Lalika commended Tanesco for making a decision to include members with special needs in its public education campaigns for the first time in its history. DC Lalika was of the view that inclusive education on Tanesco functions and entire energy sector was of paramount importance in empowering the utility company to serve people effectively by safeguarding power infrastructure. “So it is my hope that a workshop like this which is organised to groups with special needs will be a catalyst for the rest of the society to be equipped enough to contribute to the wellbeing of the entire energy sector in the country,” he noted. National Chairman of the Tanzania Deaf Association, Mr Charles Nchimbi commended the timely approach, expressing gratitude for people with hearing disabilities being sensitized on matters going on in the power sector.
