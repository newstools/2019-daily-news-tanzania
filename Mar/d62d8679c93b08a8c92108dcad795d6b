THE construction industry leader, DB Shapriya and Co Limited, has asked the Court of Appeal to dismiss an application by Yara Tanzania Limited seeking stay of execution of a decree for 8bn/- payment following a dispute involving the construction of a fertiliser facility in Kurasini. Through their counsel Nuhu Mkumbukwa, Yara Tanzania Limited, which is a leading fertiliser production company, has advanced three grounds to support the application in that they will suffer loses if execution is carried out, thus paralysing operations of the company. The counsel further told Justices Augustine Mwarija, Rehema Mkuye and Ferdinand Wambali that his client filed the application without delay and that they were willing and ready to provide a bank guarantee for due performance of the decree. However, counsel Roman Masumbuko, for the construction company, strongly objected to the application and submitted that the applicant company had failed to fulfil cumulatively the conditions set out under the Court of Appeal Rules for the Court to grant stay of execution as requested
