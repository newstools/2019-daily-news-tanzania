THE Minister of State in the President’s Office, Union Affairs and Environment, January Makamba has underpinned the need for coordination of all institutions dealing with environment and climate change data for proper planning. Mr Makamba made the remarks here yesterday when opening a workshop on national environment and climate change data collaboration organized by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). “You must have coordination of all public and private institutions dealing with statistics and data analysis on climate change and environmental issues, this will help to get away with duplication but also contradicting findings depending on one’s interest” said Mr Makamba. The minister said there are a number of public institutions which are legally authorised with environmental statistics, thus the need for NBS to do the coordination work to deal with balkanized data. “This will help to avoid frustrating users of statistics especially the findings, therefore we need concrete and authoritative ones which will assist the government in policy and decision making” he said. Moreover, he insisted on integrity and professionalism among statisticians so that in recovery missions, the statistics can be something to rely on. “Statisticians must be trusted, there is something I want to underpin, to build a professional credibility and integrity of the sector, so that whatever you produce can be of higher standards” he said. The NBS Director General, Dr Albina Chuwa said statistics and data are of paramount importance for the government in deciding on matters of policy making in the area of environment and climate change. Dr Chuwa said there is a data gap on environment issues by 60 per cent, thus the need to revert the situation.
