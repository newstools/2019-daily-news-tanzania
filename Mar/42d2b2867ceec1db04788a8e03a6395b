KAGERA Regional Commissioner Brig-Gen Marco Gaguti led thousands of mourners to receive Ruge Mutahaba’s body which arrived at Bukoba Airport at 10.45 in the morning aboard a government Fokker airplane 5H-TGF. President John Magufuli allowed the government-owned airplane to transport Ruge Mutahaba’s body from Dar to Bukoba in recognition of his enormous contribution in uplifting lives of many Tanzanians through his entrepreneurship skills. Addressing tearful mourners at the airport, Mr Gaguti described the late Ruge as a dedicated man who contributed immensely to developing and shaping the youth. “The nation has lost a noble citizen. We shall miss him immensely,” he said. Hundreds of mourners lined up the route through which the body was driven along a convoy from the airport, all the way to Kiziru village, some 15 kilometres from Bukoba town. Last respects for the deceased will be paid at the Gymkhana grounds in Bukoba Municipality between 10.00 am and 4.00 pm , after which it will be returned back to the village for burial. Ruge, who was the Programme Director at Clouds Media Group, died on Tuesday while undergoing treatment in South Africa, battling with Kidney failure for almost six months.
