THE government intends to employ librarians in the next financial year to help pupils in primary and secondary schools to cultivate a reading culture. The Minister of State in the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office, Regional Administration and Local Government, Selemani Jafo said here while officiating over a three-day Annual General Meeting (AGM) for the Tanzania Library Association (TLA), that librarians were not given their due prominence despite the fact that they were very important in the education sector. Mr Jafo said due to the dire need of librarians in schools, the office of the Permanent Secretary in the ministry was making an assessment to identify the number of librarians present and the challenges facing the sector.
