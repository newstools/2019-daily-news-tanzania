OVER 3,000 students at the Aga Khan University will at the end of this month be awarded certificates and diplomas in nursing. The representative of the Aga Khan Development Network based in Kampala, Mr Amin Mawji, said yesterday the event was an important milestone in strengthening nursing capacity in the East African Region. “Today, across the region, nurses provide care to people, often with little support or resources. Yet, we see in different parts of the region, a shortage of nurses with good generalist skills and speciality-based nurses,” said Mr Mawji. He added that recognising the needs of nurses, the Aga Khan University had been focusing on offering training on capacity building to various nurses. According to him, there are powerful reasons why strengthening of nursing is an important step in the development agenda and the impact of nurses on health outcomes is widely recognised across the world. The global economy is estimated to create about 40 million new health sector jobs by 2030, mostly in middle-income and highincome countries. Yet, despite the anticipated growth in jobs, it is estimated that there will be a projected shortage of 18 million health workers needed to achieve and sustain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) primarily in low and lowermiddle income countries.
