THE National Environment Management Council (NEMC) yesterday saluted the launch of a pilot project that seeks to ensure that expert researches are conducted before mining uranium undertaken in Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia and Namibia. Opening a one-day meeting of environment stakeholders and experts in Dar es Salaam yesterday, the NEMC Director General, Dr Samuel Gwamaka, described the project as a very welcome development in the four nations’ efforts to explore and mine safely uranium. “We welcome this pertinent pilot project. Pre-mining expert studies will tell us whether or not we should invest in mining and processing uranium. Such researches are necessary to protect the people and environment because uranium can be very harmful to creatures and environment if mishandled or carelessly used,” he told experts. He said if the four nations will agree on fundamental issues and clear mining of the mineral, they will benefit enormously because, he said, uranium contributes significantly to power generation. Major issues include safety of the mineral in mining, processing and transportation. Experts examined mining laws in the four countries, with particular focus on strategic minerals like uranium. The pilot project is sponsored by the European Union (EU) and similar expert meetings are held in each of the four countries. Earlier, the Dean of School of Environmental Sciences and Technology of the University of Dodoma, Dr Meserecordias Lema, said the workshop was critical for enabling the participants to be on same page. Delegates to yesterday’s meeting were drawn from the University of Dodoma, University of Dar es Salaam, NEMC, Ministry of Minerals and other institutions. Dodoma University will coordinate collection of information that will provide answers to intriguing questions relating to whether or not Tanzania and other nations should go ahead with uranium mi
