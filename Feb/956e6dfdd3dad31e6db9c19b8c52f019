SOME members of the Mwanga District Council in Kilimanjaro Region have suggested that the council should introduce special taxes for traditional healers. The councillors gave the suggestions when contributing ideas for the council’s 2019/2020 fiscal year budget, saying the move would increase the council’s income. “Our district has a big number of traditional healers; if we introduce taxes with special identity cards similar to those of petty traders (Machingas) our council’s revenues will increase. “In Usangi Division alone, it is predicted that there are more than 100 traditional healers; the fact that there are five divisions within Mwanga District means there are more than 500 traditional healers, if each one is charged 10,000/-, the income of our council will increase,” said Mr Amir Sarumbo, the Kirongwe Ward Councillor. His motion was supported by the Kigonigoni Ward Councillor, Mr Jeremiah Shayo, who further suggested that for a start, the council should conduct a special census that would determine the number of traditional healers working in the district. Councillor Shayo also suggested that the council should use members of the National Service (JKT) to curb illegal fishing within the district which he said continued to be a big challenge in the district. “Illegal fishing is still a major challenge within our district; if we use members of the National Service, this would help curb illegal fishing, something which would help improve the quality of fish found within our district and this would also increase our revenues,” he said. Mwanga District Council Executive Director (DED), Mr Zefrin Lubuva, advised the councillors to provide contributions that would help in identifying new sources of revenue for the council.
