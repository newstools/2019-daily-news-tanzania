Picking-nose habit could spread dangerous bacteria which cause pneumonia, new research has found. The study conducted by the European Respiratory Journal shows that the transmission of pneumonia can occur through contact between the nose and hands when exposed to the bacteria. Researchers found that the bacteria spread at the same rate whether dry or wet, or whether people pick or even just rub their noses. Statistics show that pneumonia is a major cause of death around the world and is estimated to be responsible for 1.3 million deaths in children under five years of age. A lead researcher Dr Victoria Connor advised that: â€œensuring good hand hygiene would likely reduce transmission, and lessen the risk of developing pneumococcal infection such as pneumonia."
