OVER 10,000 eligible candidates out of 14,046, who were on a waiting list due to lack of classrooms, are now at school, according to Kagera Regional Education Development Officer, Aloys Kamamba. Mr Kamamba told a regional consultative committee (RCC) meeting held at the weekend that the achievement was due to concerted effort through the construction of 200 classrooms between December last year and February this year. According to Mr Kamamba, 39,545 candidates attempted the Standard Seven examinations last year, while those selected for Form One were 25,499 (about 84.4 per cent). However, due to lack of classrooms, 14,046 missed out on the first selection. “After the construction of 200 classrooms, 4,000 candidates are still on a waiting list, while 99 classrooms are still needed,” he said. He commended Muleba District Council, which constructed 99 classrooms, allowing 3,966 students to attend school. Muleba North Legilator (CCM) Charles Mwijage disclosed it during the meeting that Muleba Council had established a bricks “bank” to address a shortage of classrooms facing the region. “Under this programme, the council has managed to construct the number of needed classrooms on time. The council was also selling extra bricks to other needy councils,” he said.
