FORMER Vice-President with the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) Michael Wambura appeared before the Kisutu Resident Magistrateâ€™s Court in Dar es Salaam yesterday, facing 17 counts of forgery, uttering false documents, money laundering and obtaining over 100m/- by false pretences. He was not allowed to enter plea to the charges before Senior Resident Magistrate Kelvin Mhina because his case falls under the Economic and Organised Crime Control Act. The case was adjourned to February 14, 2019, when the court will deliver a ruling following an application by defence. The prosecution, led by State Attorney George Barasa, as well as two officers from the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) Moza Kasubi and Imani Mizizi, told the court that the accused committed the offences between 2014 and 2015. It is alleged that on July 6, 2014 in Dar es Salaam, with intent to defraud, Wambura forged a letter, purporting that E. Maganga, the Chief Executive Officer with Jeck System Limited was demanding repayment of loan of 30,000 US dollars plus interests, which was advanced to TFF, while it was false. On the same day at TFF offices in Ilala District, knowingly and fraudulently, the accused uttered the said documents to the Federation. Between June 30, 2014 and October 2, 2015, by false pretences, Wambura obtained from TFF 100,997,924/-. The prosecution told the court that the accused purported to show that such amount was part of repayment of the loan plus interests to the company, while knowing that it was untrue. Wambura was also charged with two counts of money laundering in that between August 15, 2014 and August 21, 2015 at TFF offices in Dar es Salaam, Wambura acquired 100,947,924/-, while at such time ought to have known that the money was proceeds of predicate offence of forgery.
