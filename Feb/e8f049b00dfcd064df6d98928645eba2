THE Minister for Energy, Dr Medard Kalemani, has directed that implementation of Rural Energy Authority (REA) projects be undertaken speedily and efficiently, as he directed the authority’s board to be guided by the rule of law in their operations. Dr Kalemani gave the order here yesterday when launching a new REA board hardly three months after dissolving the previous one over incompetence. The minister gave the new board under Dr Michael Nyagonga terms of reference in their endeavours, above all close monitoring of REA’s financial aspects. He said when dissolving the previous board in November last year said he would give reasons thereafter. He said it had failed to do its assignments and was a source of conflicts. “You must make ensure that rural electrification funds are spent according to the set terms and productivity should be clearly seen,” said Dr Kalemani. He categorically told them to avoid tendencies that could cause conflicts leading to project implementation conflicts or failure to take off. “I am assigning you to resolve conflicts, most of which stem from decisions of the previous board and some dishonest REA staff,” said Dr Kalemani. Dr Kalemani also directed the new board to cast a close eye to REA project contractors, most of which he said didn’t match with the terms of their contracts, consequently delaying the rural electrification strategy, which is crucial to the nation’s industrial drive. He urged them to give priority to electricity connection to water and industrial projects since they are part and parcel of the drive. Dr Kalemani handed over to the board, a copy of the REA Act as one of its key working tools, as its members go about their routine activities.
