FIVE children who were sponsored by the Tulia Trust Organisation to pursue their secondary education in Nigeria are progressing well and their performance is superb, the organisation’s Mbeya Branch Manager, Jackline Boaz, has said. Six months ago, Tulia Trust, in collaboration with Rochas Foundation College of Africa, sponsored Anna Shitindi, Ayubu Mwaihola, Suzana Mwakilima, Bernada Fuime and Beuti Msinge to study in the West African country after completing their standard seven education in Tanzania. Founded in 2015 by Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly Dr Tulia Ackson, The Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) focuses on health and education issues in the country by helping a number of vulnerable children. According to the Mbeya branch manager, on August 3, 2018, the four girls and one boy left the country for Nigeria where they received full support from both the Nigerian embassy in Dar es Salaam and the Tanzanian embassy in Lagos and that their academic performance report was impressive. “At the Rochas Foundation College of Africa, children from 14 nations were registered for the 2018/2019 academic year but the five Tanzanian pupils are doing wonders in class despite the challenges in English language which is the medium of instruction,’’ said Ms Boaz, adding that they were, however, catching up very fast in grasping the language. Rochas Foundation College of Africa is a modern co-educational boarding school designed to provide free conducive learning environment for African students. According to Ms Boaz, the five pupils were in good health and that they were receiving the best diet at the school. According to her, apart from helping one another as Tanzanians, the six students had been equally collaborating and mingling well with their colleagues from other countries. “Tulia Trust wishes to pay tribute to Rochas Foundation College and the embassy of Nigeria in Dar es Salaam by ensuring that our children have proper access to education,’’ said Ms Boaz.
