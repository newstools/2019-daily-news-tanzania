TANZANIA Revenue Authority (TRA) has introduced Tax Consultation Bureau to assist the general public with proper knowledge on several tax provisions in the country. The TRA Director for Taxpayers Services and Education, Richard Kayombo, said in Dar es Salaam yesterday that the bureau will provide services especially to those who cannot afford to hire tax consultants. “We have decided to open this bureau after receiving opinions from our clients on the challenges they encounter, because whenever they visit our offices for consultation they don’t get in-depth knowledge in all taxation matters due to long queues and limited time,” he noted. Mr Kayombo said the bureau will provide support to other tax offices in which their clients can get plenty of time and proper knowledge on tax laws, planning and compliance. He further said that the consultant will update clients on changing tax laws and explain complicated legislations and its implications in simple terms. Other services that will be provided at the Bureau include advisory and consultancy services to clients, ensuring that they pay their taxes in the most efficient way and benefit from any tax advantages and exemptions. Expounding further, he said plans are underway to open such bureaus in Dodoma, Mwanza and Mbeya, noting that the one in Dar es Salaam will be used as a pilot to get a clear picture of consultation service needs. He further urged TRA clients to keep on using the toll-free number to give their views and complaints.
