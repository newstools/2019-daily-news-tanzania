CRDB Bank has posted a remarkable pre-tax profit last year that soared by 128 per cent with the new management succeeding to lower the bank’s non-performing loans. CRDB, the largest lender in the country, yesterday said its pre-tax profit jumped 128 per cent to 104.77bn/-last year from 46.94bn/-recorded in 2017. The announced results also showed a resilient balance sheet with significant improvement on NPLs that dropped to 8.32per cent in 2018 from 13.6 per cent in 2017. In monetary term the NPLs declined from 430.6bn/- in 2017 to 281.6bn/- in 2018 which equals a drop of 34.6per cent. CRDB’s CEO, Mr Abdulmajid Nsekela (pictured) attributed the exponential growth to increased business from individual customers, following a sustained marketing effort to promote the bank’s loan products to salaried employees. “We have achieved this by adhering to our successful strategy that continues to yield solid results. “Our long strategy remains consistent, clear and focused,” Mr Nsekela said through a statement. The lender’s introduction of the new five years strategy and a digital pillar this year, has served to build a resilient and innovative organisation with exceptional customer service and strong brand. He said despite last October change of management, the bank net profit improved significantly year on year, and rose to a record high, while all other key metrics remained healthy. “We are now on the cusp of another significant moment in CRDB Bank history, new management and the new strategy that will support the bank`s growth and transform it to provide customers with greater choice of products and services and an outstanding banking experience,” said Mr Nsekela. The leading lender, in terms of balance sheet, its total assets grew by 1.6 per cent to 5.9tri/-last year from 5.8tri/-in previous year. Moreover, deposits from customers grew by 9.9 per cent to 4.5tri/-in 2018 from 4.1tri/-in 2017.
