A 77-year-old woman died, while receiving medical treatment at Dodoma General Hospital after being raped by a 28-year-old farmer in Bihawana in Dodoma on Monday night, according to the police. Dodoma Regional Police Commander (RPC) Gilles Muroto said yesterday that the police had already arrested the farmer, who allegedly committed the crime, naming him as Mr William Simon. “The suspect is under police custody and will be arraigned over murder after investigation,” said the RPC. He further noted that the victim, who was identified as Ms Jema Macheho met the ordeal, while returning home from a local brew shop at about 11pm, saying the suspect took her by force to a nearby bush to commit the offence. “The victim was rushed to Dodoma General Hospital by her son, but she died, while receiving medical treatment,” he said. In another incident, the RPC said the police were holding Mr Leusi Lazaro (23) over theft in Dodoma-based tertiary institutions, saying Mr Lazaro, who is a resident of Dar es Salaam, had committed crimes at the University of Dodoma (Udom), St John’s University and College of Business Education (CBE). He said the suspect had been committing offences, while students were attending lectures, saying he was found with a stolen laptop owned by a CBE student and two mobile phones owned by two Udom students. The RPC also said the police had arrested three people in connection with the theft of motorcycles in Dodoma, saying the police had also impounded seven stolen motorcycles in the city. He mentioned the suspects as Mr Ngudumo Kimule (36) of Dar es Salaam, Mr Emmanuel Elias (23) and Mr Hassan Masawa (20), who were both from Nkuhungu in Dodoma City.
