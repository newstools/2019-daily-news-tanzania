ABOUT 32,000 Congolese and Burundian refugees previously hosted in various refugees’ camps in Kigoma have been transferred to other countries between 2007 and last January. The transfer of 31,874 refugees is part of strategies to seek permanent solution to the status of immigrants. Kigoma Regional Commissioner (RC) Emanuel Maganga told the visiting Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa that some of the refugees were sent to European countries and America. RC Maganga said the exercise was conducted simultaneously with the repatriation of Burundian refugees who were being hosted in Nduta and Mtendeli camps in the region. He said the repatriation of Burundians has started again after two months’ postponement due to the International Organisation for Migration’s (IOM) financial problems that impeded the operations. Commenting on the region’s security, Mr Maganga said armed robberies and kidnappings persist, with refugees from Burundi accused of being involved. The RC added that the absence of agreement on the exchange of criminals between Tanzania and Burundi contributes to continuous crimes especially armed robberies by refugees in the region. Responding, Premier Majaliwa said the government will not tolerate some people who disregard the safety and security of the country for their own benefits. The premier is today scheduled to visit Nduta Refugees Camp that accommodate Burundian refugees in Kibondo District and directly explain to the refugees the impacts of armed robberies and kidnappings by the refugees on the host community.
