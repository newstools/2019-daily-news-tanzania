MORE efforts are needed to strengthen routine immunisation and ensure that no child dies from vaccine-preventable diseases and outbreaks. About 109,885 children aged below one year in Kagera Region were immunised against Rotavirus Diarrhea and Pneumonia, last year, implying 90 per cent achievement while the target was to immunize 122,733 children. Kagera Regional Medical Officer (RMO), Dr Marco Mbata revealed that the response has been quite positive, saying: “We succeeded in vaccinating children at a proportion of 90 per cent, much higher than the 80 per cent set by the World Health Organization (WHO). 109,407 children aged below five years were immunized against Rotavirus Diarhoea and Pneumonia, during 2017. Out of the number, 29,492 children were immunized in Karagwe District, 22,677 in Muleba district while 15,683 children got PCV 13 jabs in Ngara District. Other districts with respective number in brackets include Bukoba Rural (13,696), Biharamulo (12,677), Misenyi (8,915) and Bukoba Municipal (6,131). About 1,183,155 children aged between nine months to 15 years received Measles and Rubella vaccinations during 2015 implying 93.6 per cent success while 469,943 children aged between six months to fifty nine months received Vitamin A Vaccine, an equivalent of 101.5 per cent while 425,960 children aged one year to fifty nine months received Worms medicines, implying 102.6 per cent. According to Dr Mbata, the number of dispensaries increased from 206 during 2005 to 239 by 2010, Health Centres increased from 21 (2005) to 28 (2010) while the number of hospitals also increased from 13 during 2005 to 15 by 2010. The government is keen to ensure that more lives were saved through improved health delivery and construction of health facilities including dispensaries in rural areas where most Tanzanians lived. The efforts include Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS), use of Insecticide Treated Nets (ITN) and to provide measles vaccinations and polio jabs to infants. Kagera Regional Commissioner (RC), Brigadier Gen. Marco Gaguti appealed to leaders and residents in the area to take intensive efforts in the fight against Malaria, noting that recent achievements with the prevalence level amongst children significantly dropping from 41 per cent during 2016/17 to 15.4 per cent in 2017/18, there is need to scale up malaria control interventions and continue focused intervention efforts. A recent survey shows that almost 41.7 per cent of children in Kagera Region are suffering from malnutrition. The survey indicates that the rate of stunting stands at 34.7 per cent. Underweight at 13.4 per cent, wasting at 3.8 per cent, anemia among children at 59 per cent ,Vitamin A Deficiency stood at 33 per cent, anemia among pregnant women stood at 53 per cent while Low Birth Weight (LBW) stands at seven per cent. Kagera Regional Nutrition Development Officer, Yusuf Hamis noted that a national survey conducted last year revealed that Kagera region was on topped ten regions in Mainland Tanzania, where malnutrition stood at 41.7 per cent among children aged below five years while the national average stood at 34 per cent. Other regions include Dodoma, Mwanza, Kigoma, Mbeya, Dar es Salaam, Geita, Tabora, Ruvuma and Lindi. Investing in nutrition is essential for Tanzania to progress. It is estimated that the country will lose US$20 billion by 2025 if the nutrition situation does not improve. In contrast, by investing in nutrition and improving the population’s nutritional status, the country could gain up to US$4.7 billion by 2025. Global immunisation experts who attended the biannual Regional Immunisation Technical Advisory Group (RITAG) meeting last week held in Congo’s capital, Brazzaville, urged African countries to strengthen their routine immunization. Over the past five years, immunization coverage in sub- Saharan Africa has stagnated at 72 percent, exposing populations to vaccine-preventable diseases and outbreaks. The immunization experts also emphasized the importance of increased domestic investment in disease surveillance and the need for community engagement to drive vaccine deployment during outbreaks. In sub-Saharan Africa, nearly 31 million children younger than 5 years suffer from vaccine-preventable diseases every year. More than a half million of them die due to lack of access to the vaccines they needed. In 2017, Heads of State from across Africa endorsed the Addis Declaration on Immunization, a historic pledge that envisions an Africa in which every child, no matter their economic circumstances, has access to vaccines. This year, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Regional Office for Africa, in partnership with the African Union Commission, will launch a progress report on the implementation status of the 10 commitments outlined in the Addis Declaration. The report will take stock of progress made over the past two years, highlight gaps and issue recommendations to guide progress towards stronger immunization systems. By vaccinating children, we are doing more than preventing diseases and saving lives. We are also ensuring that children get the education they deserve and returning valuable time to their families because they no longer need to make long hospital visits. Vaccinations also release scarce government funds, said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. According to WHO data, illness and deaths due to vaccine-preventable diseases cost sub-Saharan Africa US$13 billion each year– funding that could be channeled towards strengthening health systems and building economies.
