BUSINESS institutions countrywide should support the government in financing public organisations that provide social services like education and health to citizens. The call was made in Dar es Salaam over the weekend by the Deputy Minister for Energy Subira Mgalu while presiding over NMB Bank donations of school items and medical equipment worth 50m/- to six primary and three secondary schools in Temeke, Mkuranga, Mpwapwa and Misungwi districts. She said banks and other institutions should see the rationale of helping the government because the citizens whom the government strives to serve are their clients. “I thank the bank for offering to help the society, because I used to hear of such supports from them in different sectors, but today’s gesture is an example worth emulation and for sure the support complements the government’s efforts in addressing challenges in the society,” she pointed out. The bank donated 287 iron sheets, 51 desks and five computers to four primary schools at Tandika in Dares Salaam. The financial institution also donated 51office chairs and 50 desks to Magawa Secondary School and building materials to a dispensary in Nganje village, Mkuranga District in Coast Region. The health facility also received 10 Laboratory tables. Handing over the donations in Dar es Salaam, NMB Dar es Salaam Zone Manager Badru Idd said the support was in the bank’s commitment to support the government especially in serving the less fortunate communities. Mr Idd named the support beneficiaries and their receipts in brackets as Mabatini Primary School (200 iron sheets), Azimio Primary School (87 iron sheets), Karume Primary School (51 desks) and Tandika Primary School (five computers). Receiving the items for the Tandika institutions at Mabatini Primary School, Temeke Municipal Director Lusubilo Mwakabibi said the alms at Mkuranga at Magawa Primary School will ease the shortages.
