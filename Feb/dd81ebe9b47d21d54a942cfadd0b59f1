ASSOCIATION of Local Authorities of Tanzania (ALAT) plans to put up an investment centre after completing its sub-office at Tambukareli area here by the end of this month, according to the association Chairman, Mr Gulam Hafeez Mukadam. The ALAT Chairman who doubles as Mayor of Shinyanga Municipal Council made the revelation here over the weekend, pointing out that the investment centre, which is planned to be built next to ALAT sub office, will also house the association headquarters. “ALAT sub office building will temporarily house our headquarters, pending construction of the investment centre, which will house ALAT headquarters,” said Mr Mukadam during his tour of the construction project site to inspect work progress. He urged ALAT members, which include city, district and township councils, to complete their contributions to the association to facilitate the 8bn/- project of eight storey building. Mr Mukadam appreciated President John Magufuli’s pledge to support the construction project. “We decided to construct our headquarters in Dodoma to respond to the government’s directive to shift to the Capital City. We’re grateful to President Magufuli for his pledge to support the construction project,” he observed. Meanwhile, ALAT will re-launch Mayors Award planned to take place in Mwanza City in June, this year. According to Mayors Award Scheme Coordinator, Mr Wilman Ndile, the annual event which is sponsored by Tanzania Standard Newspapers Limited (TSN) aims at encouraging councils to improve performance in various areas. TSN is the publisher of ‘Daily News’, ‘Daily News on Saturday’, ‘Sunday News’, ‘HabariLeo’ and ‘HabariLeo Jumapili’. Mr Njile said nomination process in the competition will involve members of the public who will send messages to nominate the best council, adding that judges will visit the councils before making final decision to select the best council.
