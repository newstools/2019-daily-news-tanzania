THE Parliamentary Committee on HIV/Aids wants the Control-ler and Auditor General (CAG) to audit donor funds for financ-ing HIV/Aids projects in the country. Financial resources for fighting the disease are public funds obtained through govern-ment and various stakeholders’ efforts within and outside the country. Thus, the committee said yesterday since the Public Au-dit Act, 2008 denied the CAG powers to audit HIV/Aids donor funds it should be amended. Presenting the committee’s report for 2018, its chairman Oscar Mukasa said the law had to be amended so that the CAG could have the mandate also to look into the accounts of nongovernmental organisations to ascertain what was donated. “By doing this, it will strengthen the supervision of funds directed to the fight against the HIV/Aids pandemic,” he said. The committee further noted with concern that the Tanzania Commission for Aids (Tacaids)’s budget to implement development projects heavily relied on donors. “Continuing depending on donor funds doesn’t guarantee consistent fight against HIV/ Aids,” he noted. The committee, therefore, advised the government to see the importance of allocating more funds for checking the disease among citizens.
