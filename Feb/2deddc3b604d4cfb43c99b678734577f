THE government has vowed to complete surveying every piece of land countrywide in a period of five years starting this year. Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development Minister, William Lukuvi made the statement here yesterday in the Parliament. He told the August House that a pilot survey had recently been conducted in three districts of Morogoro region and showed positive results. As preparation to embark on the exercise countrywide, the government has already purchased survey equipment. The minister told the councils that lack the equipment to go and borrow from the ministry’s zonal offices located near the councils. He said the aim of surveying all lands is to ensure that every land owner pays the required taxes for the development. Mr Lukuvi gave the statement in response to an inquiry by CHADEMA Special- Seats MP, Ruth Mollel who sought to know the budget allocated for land survey in the period between 2010 and 2015. Earlier, his deputy, Anjellah Mabula explained that budget for land use management has been improved yearly. A total of 6.3bn/- was allocated for the Land Use Planning National Commission in the period between 2015 and 2018 for preparing land use plans. The Deputy Minister said that so far, at least 2,000,000 pieces of land, estimated to have 141,750 square kilometres, equivalent to 15 per cent total of all the country’s land, have been surveyed. She said the ministry continues with efforts to improve land record keeping, including land survey statistics.
