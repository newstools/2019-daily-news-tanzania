HAI District Commissioner (DC) in Kilimanjaro Region Lengai ole Sabaya has directed Hai District Executive Officer (DED)’s Office to make a follow-up and provide information about 24m/-set aside by the district council as loan to empower women and the youth. It is claimed that the money hasn’t reached the intended groups. The DC also directed the district’s Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) Office to investigate the funds set aside since 2014, but had so far not reached the intended women and youth groups. He gave the PCCB a 14- day ultimatum to provide him with their investigation findings. Mr Ole Sabaya gave the directives on Wednesday when addressing the Hai District Consultative Committee (DCC). “There is information that all measures related to the allocated funds were finalised through relevant documents, but the money hasn’t reached the intended groups up to now,” he said, adding that, PCCB should investigate the matter immediately and take legal action against the culprits in case there were any discrepancies. “The Hai District Council allocated 10 per cent of its revenue to fund women and youth groups as directed by the government, but there is information that the money has not yet reached the beneficiaries despite the fact that all documents concerning the money are finalised,” he said.
