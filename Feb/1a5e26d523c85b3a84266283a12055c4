TANZANIA Bureau of Standards (TBS) has appealed to Tarime and Rorya residents in Musoma Region to take an active role in the fight against substandard and counterfeit goods to save local industries from collapsing. This was TBS Quality Control Officer, Paul Ndegeâ€™s appeal during a sensitisation campaign to empower members of the public on how to identify and report low quality goods in the market. "The war on poor quality goods in the market will be successful if all stakeholders, including members of the public participate," he noted. He explained that the campaign TBS was implementing countrywide aimed at creating public awareness on how to identify genuine goods, which reflected value for money. TBS conducted the public campaign at new TBS Market, Tarime Bus Stand, Mtana Auction Market and other areas in Tarime District Council. "There has been a good turnout of Tarime and Rorya residents eager to get information on how to identify fake goods in the market," he said. He urged Tarime and Rorya residents to reveal traders engaged in the distribution and selling of low quality goods in the market to promote the use of products bearing TBS quality mark. He advised entrepreneurs on a need to acquire quality standard mark from TBS for their products to penetrate into the wider regional and global markets. He said entrepreneurs should utilise opportunities provided by TBS, including the quality standard mark, which was free to enable good quality products compete in the international market. He added that entrepreneurs, whose products acquired quality standard marks were currently penetrating into the East African and Southern Africa Development Community markets easily. He said the continued public awareness campaign would empower small-scale entrepreneurs to improve the quality of their products to expand business and contribution to the economy.
