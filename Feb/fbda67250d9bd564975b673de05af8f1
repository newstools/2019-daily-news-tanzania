THE Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) Annual General Meeting has effected some constitutional changes, some of which have led to creating several committees. TFF Secretary General, Wilfred Kidau said at the end of the meeting that took place here on Saturday that an emergency committee has been formed, the target being to ensure that it is on time always and goes in line with directives of the TFF. He said the emergency committee would be helpful to the executive committee of TFF in deciding basic issues for soccer development in the country if emergency occurs. He said the new committee has been formed because many of the executive committee members reside in upcountry so it is not easy to meet physically in case of emergencies. He said the committee would be meeting, making decisions promptly and late reporting the same to the executive committee. He said another committee will be dealing with medical treatment, whose chairperson must be a physician by profession. There will now be leave to appeal to CAS if a party loses its case at referral committee in the country. There will also be a position of second vice president whose holder will be coming from clubs participating in the Premier League. The secretary said that the constitutional changes have been made in accordance with FIFA directives so as to ensure improvement of the sport in the country. One of the meeting members, Isack Munis ‘Gaga’ from Kilimanjaro Region said the members made right decisions at a right time.
