A 37-year-old mother, from Uganda, living in London has been convicted for subjecting her 3-year-old daughter to female genital mutilation on Friday. The case is said to be Britainâ€™s first conviction for FGM, more than 30 years after the practice was outlawed. The woman could face up to 14 years in jail when her sentence comes out on March 8. According to Justice Philippa Whipple, the woman whose name cannot be mentioned for legal concerns, had her daughter cut at their home but later rushed her to the hospital because the girl was bleeding heavily. During the trial, the woman told that her daughter had hurt herself falling from a kitchen worktop but the girl told police she had been held down and cut by her mother. Her older brother later wrote a letter to police saying his mother had cut her.
