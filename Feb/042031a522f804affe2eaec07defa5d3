The Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court in Dar es Salaam has convicted the Queen of Ivory, Chinese Yang Feng Gian and two others of three counts of leading organised crime and dealing in 860 pieces of elephant tusks, which are government trophies valued at over 13bn/=. Principal Resident Magistrate Huruma Shaidi said that the prosecution through 11 witnesses sufficiently proved the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The two others who were convicted alongside the Queen of Ivory are Tanzanian businessmen Salivius Matembo and Manase Philemon. The court is due to deliver the sentence against the three convicts in due course later today (Tuesday) after receiving submissions from the prosecution in a sentencing hearing session.
