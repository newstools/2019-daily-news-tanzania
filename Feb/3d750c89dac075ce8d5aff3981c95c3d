THE government has issued a directive to all public institutions to consider installing security systems in their Information and Communication Technology (ICT) networks, during the implementation of e-Government. “Security in public institutions should be a compulsory matter when creating, designing, and putting up ICT networks and we need to have systems, where our experts can be able to identify what is going on instead of having the systems that will leave our people stranded,’’ said Deputy Minister of State in the President’s Office, Public Service and Good Governance, Dr Mary Mwanjelwa. The Deputy Minister was speaking while opening the second e-Government Annual Meeting, where she underscored the institutions’ need to emphasise on online security issues, which she said was still a challenge in the country. Dr Mwanjelwa further directed all heads of public institutions to empower the ICT departments by ensuring that they have enough experts, who have the highest level of professionalism in the industry and the same time equipped with skills to cope with the changing technologies. The Deputy Minister said because e-Government Authority (eGA)’s responsibilities was to coordinate all the government ICT systems, it was equally important for all public institutions to engage the authority when designing their communication systems. “I want to re-emphasise that eGA should come up with a proper plan to help our institutions in improving the ICT systems and get rid of all bottlenecks that have been impeding performance in the public service,’’ she said. e-Government is an online gateway to all services offered by the government, which has so far facilitated services delivery, besides receiving kudos from the public and various government institutions. Under the theme: ‘Harmonisation of ICT Resources Towards Industrial Development’, the four-day Annual Second e-Government Meeting held at the University of Dodoma (UDOM) brought together key stakeholders in the implementation of e-government with a view of seeking solutions of challenges facing the online gateway of all services offered by the government.
