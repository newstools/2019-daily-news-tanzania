A fire outbreak has occurred at Bora Industries Ltd, manufacturers of plastic and rubber products in Dar es Salaam on Thursday morning, destroying goods and other materials. So far the source of fire and loss resulted from the incident were not immediately established but firefighters were at the scene, trying to arrest the situation. Michael Bachubira who is operation officer with Fire Unit in Temeke Region told Daily News that Bora workers delayed to inform them and relayed on a private company which has the contract with Bora which didn’t manage to arrest the situation on time. “They informed us when the situation worsened. But as you can see we have managed to control the situation at 50 percent,” he said.
