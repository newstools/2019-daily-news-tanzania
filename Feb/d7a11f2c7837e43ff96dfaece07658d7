TANZANIA’s relations with the European Union (EU) have remained firm, with many areas of interest that connect the two partners over many years. Acting Head EU Mission in the country Charles Stuart has reaffirmed that the relations between Tanzania and EU are on solid foundations. He made the remarks in Dar es Salaam yesterday after meeting President John Magufuli at the State House. “We had a fruitful discussion, which based on the long-term relationship between Tanzania and EU as well as our intention to keep on supporting Tanzania in various areas,” he said. Earlier, President Magufuli met Zimbabwean Presi-dential special envoy who also serves as Minister of Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement Perence Shiri. The emissary submitted a letter from President Emerson Mnangagwa to Dr Magufuli. Mr Shiri thanked Tanzania for her contribution in assisting the southern country to gain independence in 1980, noting that Zimbabweans regard Tanzania as “their second home.” “We are happy to visit Tanzania, we feel at home, for us without your contribution we would have not gained independence as it would have taken us a long time, but you made it easier for us,” he noted. Last June, President Mnangagwa visited Tanzania and said his country was looking for engagement and reengagement with more friends who can trade and enjoy the common goals with Zimbabwe.
