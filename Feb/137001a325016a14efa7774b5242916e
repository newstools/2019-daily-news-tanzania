THE United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) in collaboration with local partners is set to develop an e-learning platform for pre and in service journalism education to boost qualification of journalists in line with the Media Services Act, 2016 accreditation requirements. Unesco Head of Office and Representative, Tirso Dos Santos revealed this on Wednesday during the Commemoration of World Radio Day marked at national level in Tanga Region. He said the UN agency will also provide media support for harmonisation and application of election reporting guidelines and provisions of media literacy, including the promotion of safety of journalists and inclusive participation of citizens, including women, the youth, people with disabilities and other vulnerable groups in a democratic way. Mr Santos pledged Unesco’s continued support to the government to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) through the provision of quality and timely information to all. "Together with other partners, and within the UN development framework, our work will continue contributing to achieving the SDGs by building knowledge at the grassroots, increasing access to information and amplifying the voices of those who otherwise would not be heard, leaving no one behind," he said. He added that as they worked together, they will contribute through their efforts to end violence against women and children, promote good governance, human rights and gender equity and complement community resilience, economic growth plans and social protection mechanisms for all. He said that radio remained one of the most dynamic and responsive media in the world as an immediate medium, able to cover current events in real time, connecting closely with its audience. Throughout the world, in many countries, including Tanzania, radio remains the leading media format and a low-cost medium, particularly suited to reaching isolated communities and vulnerable people and offers everyone, regardless of educational level, the opportunity to participate in public dialogue.
