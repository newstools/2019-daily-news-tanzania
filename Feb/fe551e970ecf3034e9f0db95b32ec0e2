SPEAKER Job Ndugai has said the Parliament welcomes consultations and constructive criticism from any individual, but it is not ready to be undermined. The speaker made the remarks yesterday when he was winding up the 14th Parliamentary session of the 11th Parliament in Dodoma during which he informed MPs that the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Privileges, Ethics and Powers had concluded its work, including giving its advice on the assignment it was working on. It will be remembered that three weeks ago, the Committee summoned for questioning the Controller and Auditor General (CAG), Prof Mussa Assad and Kawe MP on Chadema ticket, Halima Mdee after the two officials had, on separate occasions, made remarks that allegedly undermined the Parliament. According to Speaker Ndugai, it was not proper for any individual, including Members of Parliament (MPs) themselves to look down upon the lawmaking body as the House was performing a lot and important functions beneficial to the public. While the MPs yesterday expected to hear the verdict of the two officials who were questioned by the Committee, Speaker Ndugai informed them that the matter will now be tabled in the next Parliamentary session. Showing how MPs were hardworking people, Speaker Ndugai cited the spirit of lawmakers to work on Saturday (yesterday) when the Parliament received and deliberated on the Written Laws (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No 2) Act, 2019.
