MIDDLEMEN who bought raw cashew nut directly from farmers will not be paid when the government pays farmers for cash crop it bought because they operate against the law, the Minister for Agriculture, Josephat Hasunga has said. He said in Mkuranga District, Coast Region yesterday that government position of not paying the middlemen, infamous in cashew growing regions as `kangombaâ€™ will not change because they lack proper identification and registration as required by provisions of the Cashewnut Industry Act (2009). He said according to the law it is an offence punishable by law for business people and farmers dealing with cashew nut crop not to have proper registration.
