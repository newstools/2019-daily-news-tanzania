MODELING Inclusive Pre Education (MIPE) programme, which is implemented in Coast region’s four districts has proved successful, with 395 disabled children enrolled to school. MIPE is being implemented by Action on Disability and Development (ADD) in partnership with the government through the Ministry of Education and Tanzania’s Federation of Disabled People (SHIVYAWATA) and the Ministry of Region Administration and Local Government. ADD Country Director Rose Tesha said here during the distribution of special equipment worth over 48m/- to children living with disabilities that already 395 children have been identified and enrolled to school. “We have succeeded with the help of our partners to identify children with disabilities and enrol them to school. Additionally, we have been able to conduct training to 224 teachers on subjects concerning children with disabilities,” she revealed. She further said that the four-year programme, which started in July 2017, is implemented in Kisarawe, Mkuranga, Kibaha Town and Kibaha Rural districts. Kibaha District Commissioner Assumpter Mshama who represented the Regional Commissioner Engineer Evarist Ndikilo said the government will continue to work on ensuring that children with disabilities have equal rights to education like other children. “The government has been working to ensure that all children with disabilities are attending schools by creating friendly environment for them to study,” she said. The DC said that the region will continue to supervise its district councils and ensure that each one allocates funds for children with disabilities in their financial budgets. She said, “We will continue to improve schools’ environment, increase participation of parents of disabled children in education activities and put in practice good policies for disabled children.” She warned parents who continue with a tendency of hiding children with disabilities, saying stern measures will be taken against them.
