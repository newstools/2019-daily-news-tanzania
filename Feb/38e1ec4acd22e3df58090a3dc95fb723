President John Magufuli has called upon the judiciary to come up with strategies of establishing mobile courts that will specifically work on family heirloom cases and serve justice to widows timely. He said this when he graced the peak of this year’s Law Week commemorations at the Julius Nyerere International Convention Center, in Dar es Salaam early today. President Magufuli said such cases take so long to be concluded and it has caused agony to widows, something he says, should change. “These cases take too long and sometimes justice is not served to these widows, they lose their inheritance to other relatives and strangers,” he added.
