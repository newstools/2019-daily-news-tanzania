THE Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews (R&A) of Scotland will stage the 2019 Girls Amateur Championship at Panmure from August 13 to 17 this year. If all going well Tanzania will be among those competitors at the event. According to the world golf governing body’s press release issued early this week and this paper had its copy, this comes following an agreement reached with Montrose Links to move the event to an alternative venue. Duncan Weir, Executive Director –Golf Development and Amateur Events at The R&A, said: “We have a responsibility to all competitors to provide a world class experience in which they can perform to their full potential and this includes minimising any adverse impacts on the staging of the championship.” This change of venue has been made due to a recent announcement confirming that a series of music concerts are to be set up and staged on a site immediately adjacent to Montrose Links during the month of August according to R&A. Weir said: “There is a risk that the concerts and their setting up would have caused disruption to the players so we have come to a mutual agreement with Montrose Links that the championship will now be played at an alternative venue. “Montrose Links remains on our potential list of venues and we very much hope that the opportunity to stage another event there will present itself in the near future. “We would like to thank Panmure for moving quickly to step in at such short notice to host this championship, which is again expected to attract a world class field.” The Girls Amateur Championship that brings together top girls amateurs from around the globe will celebrate its centenary year in 2019.
