COUNCILLORS in Rorya District have approved the annual income and expenditure budget of 45,230,799,000/-, despite several revenue collection problems affecting their coffers, which has dropped to 36 percent. During the sitting held at Utegi on Wednesday, the Council authorities explained that during the previous 2018/19 fiscal year, its own source annual collections dropped slightly from 2,125,378,000/- to this year’s estimates registered as 1,350,378,000/-, something they said was likely to plunge them in difficulties in implementing their development projects. According to the District’s Human Resource Officer (HR), Joseph Leonard Jumbe, the council has taken tangible measures including the continuous use of Electronic Fiscal Devices (EFD’S) at all Animal Auction Centers so that the risk of monetary misappropriation is strictly avoided. He told the Councillors that over the past years, some Village and Ward Officers charged with the revenue collections at grassroots levels, were using the old fashioned means including the use of cashbook receipts, where of them being dishonest capitalized on the weakness to print their own extra receipt books for personal collections. ‘’From now onward, the council has directed all local village and ward officers collecting revenues on the ground to strictly adhere to the continuous use of the EFD’s to avoid any necessary future inconveniences, which used to arise,” he pointed out. Mr Jumbe said the council has also increased awareness campaigns to small scale entrepreneurs to obtain the special Presidential Identification cards at 20,000/- so that their businesses can be protected, against all sorts of discrimination and disturbances. “The Government has already started issuing special entrepreneur identification cards as a development strategy that increases abilities of tax collectors to differentiate the medium and large scale businessmen, and women from the small scale vendors, who have experienced unnecessary extortion from several tax enforcers for so long,” added the Officer. Meanwhile, in a related development during the course of discussions, the area Deputy Council Chairman, Meshack Mamba, explained that the council has put in place various disciplinary measures as well as legal ones against all parents and guardians, who collude with untrustworthy people to impregnate school girls.
