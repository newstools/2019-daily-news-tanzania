GOLD mining conglomerate Barrick Gold Corporation has reiterated its commitment to settle the US $300 million dollars (about 682.5bn/-) as a golden handshake to the government of Tanzania. The multinational’s Chief Operating Officer (COO) for Africa and Middle East, Dr Willem Jacobs, made the assurance at the State House in Dar es Salaam today (Wednesday) following a meeting with President John Magufuli. “It should be noted clearly that all that was agreed during the agreement including the payment of the golden handshake, continued investments and sharing of revenues by 50 per cent between the two parties remains intact,” the executive told Dr Magufuli. The assurance by the gold miner comes in the wake of its recent merger with Rand Gold. Barrick Gold owns 64 per cent in Acacia Tanzania, which owns sizeable gold mining interests in the country. Dr Jacobs explained that, the deal reached on October 19, 2017, between the government of Tanzania and Barrick Gold under its executive Chairman, Prof John Thornton, is still in place. The Barrick Gold Corporation’s executive informed President Magufuli that the merger between Rand Gold and Barrick Gold has significantly improved the corporation investment, financial and technical muscles. “After the merger, Barrick Gold now owns five out of ten gold resources in the world. We are more than ready to work with the government of Tanzania to ensure that the available mineral resources provide a win-win situation for the two parties,” he pledged. Dr Jacobs showered praises on President Magufuli for the zeal to protect natural resources for benefit of majority Tanzanians. Full report on Daily News on Thursday
