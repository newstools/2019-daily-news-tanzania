THE state-of-theart laboratory at Rukwa Regional Referral Hospital in Sumbawanga town whose construction was funded by Abbott Fund is inching closer to receiving a global award. The Abbott laboratory is on the process of acquiring a Five Star level international accreditation. The hospital’s Medical in Charge, Dr John Lawi told the ‘Sunday News’ here in the municipality that the last evaluation undertaken on February 2017 saw the laboratory being awarded with a four star level, which is one of the highest levels of appraisal in international accreditation. “The state-of-theart laboratory was built in 2010 through financial assistance from Abbott Fund and was officially inaugurated by the former President, Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete,” added Dr Lawi. Dr Lawi further said that the health facility started officially as a health centre in 1974 and was upgraded to a fully-fledged Regional Referral Hospital in November 2012. “This referral regional hospital provides professional services as well as handling referral cases to a population of 1,192, 366,” he added.
