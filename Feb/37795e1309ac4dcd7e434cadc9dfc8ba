PRESIDENT Ali Mohamed Shein, on two separate days, organised lunch for young people and defence and security forces to thank them for making the 55th anniversary of Z anzibar Revolution successful. “We recognise and value your role in the country. Well done for the colourful celebration on January 12, this year, in Pemba,” said Mr Issa Haji Ussi ‘Gavu’, State Minister (State House Affairs) on behalf of the President. He said taking part in such an event was important for the youth because they got to learn about history of their country, particularly Revolution. “We should continue with this celebration annually so that Revolution sticks in our mind and safeguard it. Revolution means a lot to us, including unity and development for the people.” The lunch event was also attended by high ranking leaders, including ministers led by Second Vice President Seif Ali Iddi.
