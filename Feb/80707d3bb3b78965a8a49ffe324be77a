RORYA District Commissioner (DC), Mr Simon Chacha has said that stern measures, including legal action will be taken against parents and guardians, who obstruct local authority's initiatives from punishing people suspected to be impregnating school girls. He hinted that some dishonest parents around here have been opting to protect those who impregnate school girls, by advising that they settle the matters out of court, including hiding their identity, and that in turn hinders police investigators and arrests.
