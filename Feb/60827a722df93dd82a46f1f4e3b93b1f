PRIME Minister Kassim Majaliwa has ordered the Ministry of Industry and Trade to ensure that Kwitanga prison gets a modern palm oil factory as part of the government’s drive to boost palm production in the country. Tanzania has a vast and promising production potential in palm oil and sunflower sub-sectors. The prime minister was satisfied with efforts by the prisons department to improve its palm estate as well as develop its palm oil industry. He issued the directive after visiting Kwitanga prison in Kigoma region, during which he inspected the palm farm and launched a tractor and one cell built in the prison. “I have been pleased to see newly installed machine for processing palm oil at the factory,” he said after seeing the machine, which will replace the old one that was manually operated. In ensuring that Kwitanga prison becomes exemplary to others in palm agriculture, Mr Majaliwa also directed the Home Affairs Ministry to purchase a winch that will ease harvest of the palms. He criticised the current system of harvesting the palm whereby they climb palm trees during harvest seasons, saying it was not safe. Head of prisons in Kigoma region, Mr Leonard Burushi, said the department has increased annual production of palm oil from 63.4 barrels in 2016 /2017 to 97 barrels in 2018/2019. He attributed the production rise to the premier’s directives when visited the prison in July last year, during which, among other things, he ordered the management to improve the factory for palm oil processing. Mr Burushi told the premier that they have earmarked 20 acres for constriction of the modern palm oil factory and warehouses for storage of waste palm oil. Regarding Prime Minister’s directive to expand palm farms to increase production, he said Ilagala and Kwitanga prisons have already prepared 150 and 400 acres, respectively, for growing of palm trees.
