THE Judiciary has called for regular capacity building programmes for staff in lower courts, as evidence reveals a number of unsatisfactory performance in many of the ward tribunals in Mwanza Region. That was pointed out here yesterday by the Judge In-charge of the Mwanza High Court Zone Sam Rumanyika shortly after opening the seminar for magistrates and members of ward tribunals in Mwanza City being part of the continuous educational programmes targeting to enhance their performance. Judge Rumanyika said many of the tribunals were poorly organised with limited capacity in writing rulings, and some making rulings that were not at their jurisdiction levels. He stressed that the tribunals should be revitalised, proposing establishment of a special fund to oversee among other things, provision of regular capacity building programmes for members of ward tribunals. “Yes, we have a problem on the area of work performance of the ward tribunals; that is why this seminar has been organised, to ensure that magistrates and members of these tribunals are supported to overcome their operational challenges,” he said. According to Judge Rumanyika, the need to organise such programmes was stressed by Chief Justice Prof Ibrahim Juma during his working tour of Tabora Region last year when he was briefed about poor justice delivery by many Ward Tribunal members. The former Institute of Judicial Administration (IJA) Deputy Rector responsible for Academic, Research and Consultancy who was recently appointed by President John Magufuli as Judge of the High Court, Fahamu Mtulia, said IJA took up the responsibility of conducting the capacity building programmes as directed by the Chief Justice. The seminar was designed to impart additional tools in seeking to sharpen their skills as they undertake their daily functions, particularly the administration of justice at the lower levels of the Judiciary. The seminar was also meant to remind primary courts magistrates on their roles and the linkages between them and ward tribunals in dispensing timely justice for all. “So we have started providing these training sessions, starting with Tabora Region last year and we will be here up to March with at least 30 tribunals,
