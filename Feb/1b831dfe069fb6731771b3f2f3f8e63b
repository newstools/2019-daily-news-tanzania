ALL goldmines be it a small or big one operating in Mara Region must pay tax or closed, the Regional Commissioner (RC) Adam Malima has warned. The RC issued the warning here recently, while introducing the new Tarime District Commissioner (DC) Francis Charles Kabeho in the area. Mr Malima said the district has many small scale miners, who are not paying taxes, something which must come to an end, he pointed out, stressing that: “I will close all gold mines which do not pay taxes.”
