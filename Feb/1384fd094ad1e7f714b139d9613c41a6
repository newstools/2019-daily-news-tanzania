THE government has suspended five mining officers over alleged issuance of dubious mining licences. Minister for Minerals Dotto Biteko told reporters here yesterday that the suspension goes along with other disciplinary actions. Three of the suspended officials are alleged to have been involved in issuance of licences reserved for small scale miners to big mining companies. “In a bid to empower small scale miners economically, the government allocated special areas for them, but the three officials decided to offer licences to big companies knowing that it was against the law,” he said. He said the government will never tolerate any official violating the law in their personal interests. Mr Biteko directed the mining commission to suspend two other officials pending other disciplinary measures. The suspension of the two officials brings to five the number of suspended officers. He accused the two officials of issuing the mining licences to foreigners in areas reserved for small scale miners at the Mirerani Tanzanite mine. Mr Biteko said the mining officers issued three primary mining licences to Kenyans. The minister said the decision has been reached following a number of complaints from small scale miners over demarcated areas that were given to foreigners by unfaithful officials in the mining commission office. He added that the ministry had contacted the immigration department to know the status of the accused and it was realised that the small scale miners had genuine complaints. Mr Biteko expressed his ministry commitment to empower small scale miners, saying last January a series of trainings were conducted in Singida, Chunya, Mpanda, Handeni, Buhemba, Kyerwa and Bukombe. He said the government has spent 12bn/- on construction of seven centres of excellence and three demonstration centres, saying the centre launch is scheduled for next month.
