PRIME Minister Kassim Majaliwa has assured that the government will continue taking legal measures against cooperative societies’ dishonest leaders involved in property theft and embezzlement of members’ money. The Premier was speaking at different times during his tour of Kilimanjaro region, which he described among the best, with strong cooperative societies but some have collapsed due to greedy and dishonest leaders. He said the government determinant is to see the cooperatives performing impressively for the betterment of farmers and the nation at large. “The government is keen to see improvement and good performance in various sectors across the country, this is our position and direction,” noted the premier. He added: “We want to see improvement in coffee production, we are aware that leaders of cooperative unions have disappointed farmers in this region.” Mr Majaliwa said the government has started taking stern actions against those accused of swindling cooperatives’ funds, vowing that no stone will remain unturned. According to the premier, poor leadership and embezzlement of funds have led to poor crop production, which has also resulted into abject poverty among wananchi. “These cooperative unions have been weakened by poor leaders, we need to take serious measures to ensure they stand again,” he said. The premier said the Tanzania Coffee Research Institute (TaCRI) is providing the best coffee seedlings to all farmers in improving the cash crop in the region. He also reminded district councils’ workers in the region to get out of their offices and give support to farmers whenever they are required to do so. While in Rombo District, Premier Majaliwa received a report from District Commissioner (DC) Agness Hokororo who said the district has started cultivating avocado as its cash crop after coffee underperformed in the area. The premier said the government is overseeing five strategic crops—coffee, tea, cotton, tobacco and cashew nut.
