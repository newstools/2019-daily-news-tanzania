POLICE in Rukwa Region have arrested Maria Sui (43), a resident of Kanyarakata village, Mbuluma Ward in Kalambo District, for allegedly killing her husband, Dismas Mwanakulya (55), by hitting him on head with an object. The Rukwa Regional Police Commander (RPC) Mr George Kyando said the incident occurred at their house, while Mwanakulya was asleep. “Preliminary police investigation indicates that the source of the incident is sheer jealous after Maria accused her husband of having extra marital affairs with another woman,” he added. Mr Kyando further said that the suspect was thereafter arrested, and will soon be arraigned in court once investigations are completed. On her side, Matai Division Officer, Mr Andrew Ngido told the ‘Daily News’ that on the material day, the couple visited a nearby Pub, where Maria saw her husband chatting and taking beer with another woman some hours before her arrival. “The irate wife rushed back home and her husband was said to have returned home later, drunk and went straight to bed, where he fell asleep only to be slain ,” he pointed out. Meanwhile, the RPC called upon the residents especially married couples to refrain from taking laws in their hands by killing each other.
