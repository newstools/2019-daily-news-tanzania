TANZANIANS have been urged to embrace a Will writing culture which among other things averts squa bbles in case of the demise of a family member. Tanzania Cigarette Company (TCC Plc) Employee Relations Manager, Masoud Matange, said during the Will Programme Week, which was specifically dedicated for the sensitisation of Will writing among employees. “The programme was launched in 2008 with the aim of protecting employees’ dependents when one dies,” Mr Matange said. He added that TCC is trying to build the culture so that more employees can write and update their Wills from time to time. The service is free of charge and the company through the HR Department has contracted a reputable legal firm that conducts the process where employees willingly write their Wills and update them any time when they want. “The legal firm helps in conducting the sensitisation, writing process, preservation/ custodian and reading of the Will,” he said. He said they decided to come up with this unique programme to avert many conflicts that arise among family members when a staff dies. “This is a challenge not just to TCC employees but to all employees out there as this is the only way they can ensure that they do not leave disputes behind in case a death occurs,” he said. One of the TCC employees, who took part in the project, thanked the company for the initiative saying not all employers can offer such a unique service saying that employees have been well sensitised on the matter. “The service is free of charge hence gives more employees the chance to come out, write and update their Wills,” she said. Another employee said he worked in two other places before joining TCC Plc but never gotten the opportunity to write a Will. “I was so touched to get such kind of push from the company as very few employers will do such a thing for employees free of charge,” he said.
