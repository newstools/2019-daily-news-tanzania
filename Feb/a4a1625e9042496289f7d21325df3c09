THE police are holding 13 people allegedly from Ethiopia for illegally entering and staying in the country. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mwanza Regional Police Commander Muliro Jumanne Muliro said the Ethiopian nationals were arrested after the police were tipped of the presence of unfamiliar individuals in Ntamazobe, Nyaburugoya Street in Nyegezi Ward, Nyamagana. According to the RPC, some villagers told the police that 13 unknown people were wandering around a farm of one of the villagers in Nyaburugoya. “The police immediately launched a patrol and arrested 13 people, who were later identified as Ethiopians with five of them possessing passports issued in Ethiopia and stamped in Kenya, but had no Tanzania Immigration Office’s stamp,” said Mr Muliro. The police’s efforts to interrogate them on their illegal migration failed to bear desired fruits as all of them spoke neither English nor Kiswahili. This fact made the police detain them until an interpreter of their native language was found to help know where they were going. He noted that one Tanzanian known by a single name as David was suspected of being behind them, but he escaped before the police were able to hold him for interrogation. He mentioned the illegal immigrants with their ages in brackets as Detebe Degawa (26), Daniel Girima (28), Tadwas Addise (23), Teshome Tumebo (26) Solomon Alficho (21), Rile Abat (24), Malkam Tadas (22), Ashanani Degara (21), Chufamo Badoro (37), Mamushi Hiremarian (23), Tekile Dilamo (25) Yose Manto (22), and Dawit Abebe (21). They are held at Mwanza Immigration Office for further action. RPC Muliro, who has just reported in Mwanza to replace former RPC Jonathan Shanna, who was transferred to the police headquarters in Dar es Salaam, warned young people against involving in illegal deals that made them leave the country for greener pastures, but some of them ended in regretting.
