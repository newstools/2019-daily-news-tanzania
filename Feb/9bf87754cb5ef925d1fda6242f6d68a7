THE Kisutu Resident Magistrateâ€™s Court in Dar es Salaam has turned down a request by the defence for dismissing the 1bn/- economic sabotage and abuse of position charges against three people surrounding implementation of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) Line Project. Principal Resident Magistrate Thomas Simba said that the case against the accused persons had been preferred by the prosecution as an economic one, thus, the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain anything, unless it was given powers by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). The lawyers for the accused, Dr Rugemeleza Nshala and Mr Jeremia Mtobesya, had pushed for the dismissal of the charges and acquittal of their clients because the prosecution has failed to prosecute the case since the arraignment of their clients more than three years ago. Responding to the submissions, the Prosecutor with Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB), Magela Ndimbo, argued that the case against the accused fell under the Economic and Organised Crime Control Act, whose investigations was not governed under the Criminal Procedure Act. Referring to sections 29 and 30 of the Economic Act, once the charge is read to the accused, the court may grant or not grant bail, while after completion of investigations the court file is taken to the DPP for him to decide on the way forward. In his short ruling, the magistrate noted that already, the DPP had conferred powers to the court to conduct the trial instead of the High Court. Under the circumstances, he said, there would not be any bar for the court to proceed hearing the case. After delivering the ruling, the magistrate adjourned the case to February 27, 2019 to allow the prosecution to read and explain afresh the charges to the accused persons to enable them enter a plea before commencement of the full trial. The accused in the trial include former Director General with Reli Assets Holding Company (RAHCO), Engineer Benhadard Tito, Kanji Mwinyijuma, a businessman and Emanuel Massawe, ex-RAHCO Company Secretary.
