MEMBERS of the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA) were yesterday informed that it was noteworthy that Kiswahili had been unanimously accepted as one of the potential major facilitators of East African Community (EAC) regional integration and sustainable development. “We feel elated that the East Africa Kiswahili Centre (EAKC) is based in Zanzibar. We are also proud that with the revival of the EAC, the language has now formally been our regional lingua franca,” Zanzibar President Dr Ali Mohamed Shein said at the opening of the 4th meeting of the second session of the EALA being held here. He praised the initiatives taken by the EAKC for promoting the use of Kiswahili within the region and beyond, and that the Zanzibar government through its Kiswahili Council, BAKIZA, launched an international symposium in December last year. He informed the audience at the opening of the assembly that last year’s symposium aimed at mobilising Kiswahili experts around the globe to share ideas on how further the language’s potential could be scaled to greater heights nationally and globally. “The symposium also aimed at recognising and acknowledging literary and artistic works of local Kiswahili authors and artists. It was a remarkable occasion that attracted the interest of most of the participants and urged the government to continue with the practice,” he said. Dr Shein said there were various avenues that could be examined in the language, and hence strengthen their determination to ensure proper harmonisation and coordination of the development and use of Kiswahili. This, he further explained, would enhance Kiswahili’s status as the language of formal and non-formal communication in the EAC partner states.
