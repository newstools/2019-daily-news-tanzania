THE coming in of two football experts from Germany has been described as fundamental towards uplifting football standards in the country. The coaches who are Andreas Pach, Martin Hammel and an interpreter Veronika Kral are running a one-week special training programme under ITK Pathfinder at JMK Youth Park in Dar es Salaam where 25 coaches from different academies are grasping skills on Youth Football Coaching. Speaking over the weekend here, Chairman of the Magnet Youth Sports Organisation, Tuntufye Mwambusi said the programme will have multiplying factor once completed. “I hope that these coaches will be able to impart the tactics they are getting to their colleagues who could not attend this training. We have many football coaches in the country but most of them do not have essential abilities to coach youth players,” Mwambusi said. He added that the second phase of the project would see its ambassador Yussuf Paulsen who is of Tanzania origin and plays for Denmark national football team coming in the country to embrace the initiative. Moreover, Mwambusi hailed the support they have received from the Minister for Information, Culture, Arts and Sports Harrison Mwakyembe and Tanzania Football Federation for blessing the project. On his part, Tanzania Tourist Board Marketing Officer Francis Malugu said the underway project will help to facilitate tourism. “We plan to take them (coaches) to different tourism attraction places both here and in Zanzibar so that when they return back to German, they should be good ambassadors of the nation,” Malugu said. Also, a beneficiary of the training Kassim Liogope said they are getting extra skills which will help them a lot as far as coaching young people in academies is concerned.
