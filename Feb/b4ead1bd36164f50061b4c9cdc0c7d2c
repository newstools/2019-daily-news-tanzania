MEMBERS of the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA) Tanzania Chapter have launched an awareness creation campaign aiming at equipping Tanzanian youth with knowledge and opportunities to be explored in the East African Community (EAC) member countries. EALA Tanzania Chapter chairperson, Dr Abdullah Ma kame, told the ‘Business Standard’ in Dar es Salaam recently that the campaign is focusing on stimulating the youth mind and make them think regionally. “Youths are providing main part of the workforce. They need EAC issues awareness to prepare them for grabbing available business opportunities,” he said. Another EALA member, Happiness Lugiko said to start with, Tanzania has a high potential of producing food that can feed the whole East Africa and beyond and therefore young people are to prepare and benefit from agribusiness. “Young people are to embark on modern agriculture, most of the EAC member countries are meeting food requirement for their population from outside EAC and African continent while Tanzania has enough land to farm crops like rice,” she said. She said the youth should stop complaining and be more creative citing uses of the country’s border posts to set business centres that would help to shorten EAC traders trips to Dar es Salaam for instance to seek goods for their domestic market. “Use Rusumo border to meet demands by Rwandese and Congolese traders who flock to Dar es Salaam regularly in search of other goods and food items like rice and maize. Young people must be aggressive than waiting for the government to do everything for them,” she said. The MP also insisted on knowledge gaining through reading various publications and being aggressive to conquer fellow traders from the economic bloc.
