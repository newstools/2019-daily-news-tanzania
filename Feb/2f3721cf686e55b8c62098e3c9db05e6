SMALL scale miners in Dar es Salaam and Coast regions have requested the government to set up mechanism of recognising their activities and enable them to pay tax. The Chairman of the Dar es Salaam and Coast regions Miners Association (DACOREMA), Mr Michael Lupiana said small-scale miners are ready to support the government’s efforts in boosting the national income through tax but the absence of good mechanism hindered them. He made the remarks during the peaceful demonstration to congratulate the government for addressing challenges facing mining sector by amending some sections of the Mining Act and establishment of minerals’ market for emergence certificate. “Statistics show that about 80 per cent of small miners are working without having licences which means they are not paying tax, a thing which is affecting our country’s economic development negatively,” he said. The demonstration which involved about 300 small miners from Dar es Salaam and Coast regions held yesterday from Mpiji bridge to Bunju W ard offices in Kinondoni Municipality in Dar es Salaam. He further advised the authority to raise awareness to small miners on the importance of having licence for carrying mining activities. One of the challenges facing small miners is 15 per cent service charge by district councils and municipalities which is against the law that allows charging only 3 per cent. At the same occasion a small-scale miner identified as Hashimu Makombe said lack of knowledge on how to operate their activities according to country’s regulations is the major challenge limiting their growth and contribution to the economy. On her side a small miner Maria Mapalala requested the government to allocate areas for sand and stone mining because they don’t have areas for their activities despite of paying charges.
