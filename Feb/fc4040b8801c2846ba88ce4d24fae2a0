TANZANIA and Ukraine plan to convene a special business conference in Dar es Salaam on Tuesday to, among other things, deliberate on business opportunities available in each side. A statement issued by Tanzania Trade Development Authority (TanTrade) yesterday says the meeting will be coordinated jointly. According to the statement, the main objective of the conference, which will be held at Julius Nyerere International Convention Centre, is to identify types of commodities and business tactics that will enable Tanzanian companies win business in Ukraine and vice-versa. Targeted groups include growers of coffee, spices,sesame and fruits capable of exporting their produce and businesspersons engaging in pharmaceutical products. Tanzania, in recent years, has been searching for markets for its agricultural produce outside its borders. China, for instance, has been serving as a reliable market for agricultural products from Tanzania. Such products include fruits, spices and vegetables. Tanzania has agreement with China whereby the former is entitled to supply cassava in large quantity. In May last year, Chinese ambassador to Tanzania Wang Ke held a meeting with Tanzaniaâ€™s Private Sector Foundation (TPSF) officials in which she asked the government to support its agricultural sector with a view to enhancing sustainable cassava production. Ambassador Wang told TPSF officials China signed agreements involving imports of cassava products, but of the required 100,000 tonnes annually, only 10,000 tonnes were from Tanzania.
