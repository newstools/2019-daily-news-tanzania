At least 23 gold miners were feared dead in Zimbabwe on Thursday after water flooded two disused shafts in a mining town 145km south-west of the capital, Harare. Rescuers were trying to use pumps to extract water in the search for survivors and bodies at the site near the town of Kadoma. "We heard from their colleagues that at least 23 people are trapped in the mine shaft which was flooded by water from a dam wall which burst due to heavy rains on Tuesday night," Wilson Gwatiringa, spokesman for mining company RioZim, owners of one of the mines, told AFP news agency. "One of them is our mine which was no longer in operation. We are assisting on humanitarian grounds."
