TRADEMARK East Africa (TMEA) has advised media to give priority to the East African Community (EAC) agenda that will help youth compete and grab various opportunities in the regional market. “Since information is power, youth in the country ought to be informed and benefit from the various opportunities in the regional integration,” said the TMEA Country Director John Ulanga during the EAC awareness creation campaign among the university students. He added, “Media information will help youth gain knowledge on the functioning of EAC Customs protocol, Common market Protocol and the Monetary Union protocol and eventually benefit from the economic integration which is the home for over 160 million people,” He said that there were negative views among the Tanzania youth that their counterparts from EAC member states are exploiting them but all they do is access to information which they later put into action. For example, some Kenyan televisions are running shows and discussions on daily basis about the EAC agenda and the means of benefiting from the available opportunities. He went on clarifying that it was for district and regional authorities in the country to change on how the do things to benefit people. “Tanzania is bordered with six land locked countries presenting unique potentiality to be reaped and benefit youth in the country,” he said. However, Mr Ulanga said that the EAC economic block was facing some challenges in doing business, mainly being Non-Tariff Trade Barriers (NTTB) which hinder importation and exportation from a country to another.
