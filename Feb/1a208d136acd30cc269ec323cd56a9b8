ABOUT 15 ,000 people including entrepreneurs in the Lake Zones have been reached by the Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) public campaigns on how to identify and ultimately remove substandard goods from the market. The Bureau’s Senior Marketing Officer, Ms Gladness Kaseka said over the weekend that the public campaigns in the Lake Zones have been successful and they have managed to reach many people at the grassroots level. “The war against poor quality goods in the market aimed at saving the local manufacturing sector will be successful if all stakeholders including the public join their efforts,” she said. The bureau conducted the said public campaigns at the district level including Bukoka in Kagera Region, Kahama in Shinyanga Region, Tarime in Mara Region and Nyamagana in Mwanza Region. She said the public campaigns in the Lake Zones are part of the initiatives implemented by the Bureau countrywide with the aim of creating public awareness on how to identify genuine and quality goods which reflect the value for money. She said the continued public awareness campaign will empower small-scale entrepreneurs to improve the quality of their products in order to expand business and contribution to the economy. She advised entrepreneurs on the need to acquire quality standard mark from the TBS for their products to penetrate the wider regional and global markets. She said entrepreneurs may use various opportunities provided by the TBS including the quality standard mark which is free as a way to enhance the products value to compete in the international markets.
