HOME Affairs Minister Kangi Lugola has warned murders of elders, wherever they would be countrywide that their days are numbered and none would be spared. The minister made the remark, while presiding over a two-day workshop over the weekend to chart strategies that would end the killings of aged people countrywide. Organised by an organisation that works to help older people in Tanzania to live in secure lives—HelpAge, the workshop brought together representatives from the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, Ministry of State in the President’s Office, Regional Administration and Local Government and Ministry of Home Affairs, specifically the Police Force. Speaking while opening the workshop, Mr Lugola said the Police Force has a special force dealing with the killers elders, which he directed to intensify their fight against the killers. “I direct all the Regional Police Commanders (RPCs) to curb these killings and failure is not an option, because we have a special force dealing with these killings in every region,’’ he said. With several RPCs in attendance, the Minister further said that through the Police’s commission of intelligence and a special task force within it, all perpetrators should be hunted, arrested and prosecuted as per the law. Mr Lugola said even religious books insist that killing is a sin and that the constitution also guarantees for their right to life, adding: “Therefore, there is no killer who shall remain safe as the country implements the plan to have zero killings of older men and women by 2023.” At the workshop themed ‘We need Tanzania that is free from killings of older people towards middle income economy through industrialisation, a representative of elders, Ms Clotilda Kokupima said many killings of the elders were orchestrated by superstitious beliefs, and called for a comprehensive legal framework that would curb them. “We have the National Ageing Policy of 2003, but we are disappointed that for all those years despite having the policy we do not have the Ageing Act,’’ she said, while asking the government to consider coming up with the law.
