OVER 400 inmates are forced to sleep in shifts due to congestion at the Mpanda District Prison in Katavi Region. The Katavi Regional Magistrate Court’s Principal Resident, Mr Emmanuel Ngigwana made the revelation recently during the climax of Law Day held here at the Mpanda District Magistrate’s Court ground. Mr Ngigwana further explained that due to overcrowding, inmates are compelled to sleep in shifts because the undersized room has a capacity of accommodating 100 inmates only. “It is high time the region leadership embarks on construction of a remand prison building in Mlele District in the region which lacks the facility, forcing inmates to be transferred to Mpanda District Prison, which is already congested,” he said. Responding, the Katavi Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr Amos Makalla admitted that overcrowding at the Mpanda District Prison is a big challenge which must be addressed with immediate effect. “However, the good news is that we as the regional government have already started taking action by liaising with the Ministry of Home Affairs and consequently have agreed that in collaboration with Katavi regional government we should construct a prison facility in Mlele District in a bid to address the situation,” added the RC. For his part, the Katavi Regional Crime Officer (RCO), Mr Elisante Masaka hailed journalists in the area for their boldness and bravery in uncovering the story which has human interest.
