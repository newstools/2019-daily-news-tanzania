HOME Affairs Minister Mr Kangi Lugola has warned against the use police vehicles in escorting illicit drugs. Winding up his two day tour of Arumeru District at the weekend, the minister was categorical that police vehicles ought to only be used in patrols and ferrying of suspects and not drugs. Mr Lugola said he was aware of some police vehicles being involved in the ‘crime’, adding that he wouldn’t allow such a thing to happen under his watch. “The senior police officers who have been facilitating such a crime should now be packing their effects because their days are surely numbered,” warned the minister shortly after handing over a repaired vehicle to the Arumeru District Commissioner’s office. The Land Rover 110 vehicle was repaired by the Friedkin Conservation Fund in bolstering security in the district. The minister further appealed to other organisation to complement the district’s endeavour of boosting security. Located on Mt Meru’s foothills, some of the residents in the district are known for cultivation of the illicit drugs. In 2016, the Arusha regional police force seized and destroyed 26 tonnes of marijuana in a crackdown operation carried out on the slopes of Mount Meru. During the one-month crackdown, a total of 269 bags of marijuana were seized in different locations across Arumeru, believed to be the biggest seizure of drugs in recent years in the East African nation. The seized bags of cannabis have been destroyed at the Muriet dumpsite, located a few kilometres from Arusha City Centre. Two years ago, officials from the country’s Drug Control and Enforcement Authority (DCEA) seized 500 bags of marijuana in a night operation at Lenglong Village in Arumeru District. The special task force in collaboration with the district authorities also seized six bags of marijuana seeds at the village.
