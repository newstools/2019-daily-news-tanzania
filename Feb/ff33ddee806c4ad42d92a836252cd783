LIVESTOCK and Fisheries Minister Luhaga Mpina has faulted the system used to conduct livestock research in the country, saying many studies lack specific objectives to help in bringing proper answers to Tanzanians. He said many researchers focus on business based studies, which involve other countries without considering the proper situation in the country. Mr Mpina charged that there has been poor participation of stakeholders in the country and instead of disseminating results to wananchi, the research findings reach few people, contrary to the government goals. He was speaking after visiting the multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET) project, which is implemented by Tanzania Livestock Research Institute (TALIRI) at Mpwapwa centre in Dodoma region. “Tanzanians should be proud of this centre, it is the first project in East and Central Africa,” he said. He said MOET project enables Tanzania to stimulate livestock sector through increased meat and milk production as well as livestock hides and skin processing. The minister said the government is doing everything in its capacity to ensure there is improvement in the livestock sector and that all efforts will be meaningless if the existing challenges are not addressed. He ordered the Ministry’s Director for Research, Training and Extension to prepare regulations that will guide officials in fulfilling various activities in the sector. He also ordered the department under his office to present a research plan at TALIRI in March every year. “The director should meet wananchi who are engaged in poultry farming, goat, sheep, donkey and pigs keeping as well as owners of meat and skin processing factories to listen to their problems and challenges they face. TARILI Director General Dr Eligy Shirima said the Commission for Science and Technology is funding the MOET project at 400m/-.
