CONSTRUCTION of a district hospital in Kibaha, Coast Region is scheduled to commence soon as the government has already released funds for the project. The construction of the hospital is expected to cost 1.5bn/- upon completion and the work will be completed in seven months from now. Member of Parliament for Kibaha Town, Mr Sylivestry Koka said recently after inspecting the area where the hospital will be built at Lulanzi Street in Picha ya Ndege Ward that the government through the Ministry of Regional Administration and Local Government has released the money and construction work will commence very soon. He commended the government for disbursing the funds for the construction of the hospital, adding that Kibaha residents will continue to show their support and appreciation by working hard to bring development for themselves and the country. On the other hand, the MP called upon all people who will be involved in the construction of the hospital to be trustworthy for the successful implementation of the project. “This is a big project which needs to be done with perfection to guarantee value for money. I am requesting all responsible individuals in managing this work to be committed as expected,” he emphasised. He further said that having the hospital in place will be a good way of moving the medical services closer to people of all ages. On his part, the Picha ya Ndege Ward Councillor, Mr Robert Machumbe said that Kibaha residents are happy with the fact that they will be assured of accessing reliable medical services without encountering any difficulties. “This hospital will be a solution to the congestion we are currently facing at Tumbi Regional Hospital which is working over its capacity since it also serves patients from nearby regions,” he said.
