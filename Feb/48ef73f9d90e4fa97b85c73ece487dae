THE international Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC) has secured a major agreement with the World Bank that will see the international funding organisation adopt the use of six FIDIC standard contracts for the next five years. Under the terms of agreement, FIDIC has granted the World Bank a non-exclusive licence to refer to the six major FIDIC contracts for projects they finance and the document will be used as part of the bank’s standard bidding documents, according to a statement issued by FIDIC earlier this week. “The contracts mainly include the 2017 Second edition FIDIC contracts, which cover a wide range of international construction and infrastructure work and the World Bank’s move represents a major endorsement for the contracts from a major international funding organisation,” the statement said.
