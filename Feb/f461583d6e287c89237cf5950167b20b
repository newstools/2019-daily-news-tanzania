PARLIAMENTARY Committee on Industries, Trade and Environment has revealed irregularities in issuance of sugar import permits, saying the permits were issued without considering country’s deficit of the commodity in the market. The committee told the National Assembly yesterday that the situation was a loophole that the unscrupulous dealers used to import more sugar. When presenting report of the committee for 2018, Chairman of the committee, Mr Suleiman Saddiq said the government should take action against the businessmen because they affect local production and market of the locally produced domestic sugar, thus affecting employment to the locals. “The Parliament advises the government to do reassessment of the capacity of the local sugar manufacturers before issuing the new permits for 2019 in order to establish a sugar gap in the country,” Mr Saddiq said. On the other hand, he alleged that there was nepotism in issuance of the permits, something which delays the availability of industrial sugar in the local soft drinks industries. Meanwhile, the committee said it also discovered presence of fake products in the local market including iron bars and iron sheets, a situation which raises questions over control of such products at borders. “We call upon the government to strengthen control measures at ports especially Dar es Salaam port,” he said. The committee went on advising the government to privatise the Tanzania Fertilisers Company (TFC), a move which the committee believes that it would help in guaranteeing the supply of enough fertilisers to the farmers, and the government would collect taxes. Speaking over developing the small scale industries in the country, the committee said there was a need to boost capacity of the Small Industries Development Organisation (SIDO) by allocating more budget for it to apply modern technologies for production, noting that the small scale industries provide employment opportunities to many Tanzanians.
