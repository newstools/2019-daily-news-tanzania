Regional Police Commander Hamis Issah said yesterday that his office had already discovered the trick, and that a special operation was being conducted to arrest all suspects. He added that the suspects were also making some modifications on various vehicles to enable them hide drugs and transport them to various destinations. “We are aware that the suspects are also making modifications on vehicles so that they can hide illicit drugs; we are following up on this matter closely,” he said. He said police officers were currently conducting a special operation in the region by stopping vehicles for inspection. “I would like to inform the public that police officers are doing their job, therefore they should cooperate wherever they are asked to do so,” he said.
