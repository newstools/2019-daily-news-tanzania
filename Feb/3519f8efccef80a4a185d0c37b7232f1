TANZANIA Posts Corporation (TPC) has expressed commitment to combat illicit drug trafficking through its courier services for parcels transferred within and outside the country. The Postmaster General, Mr Hassan Mwang’ombe said in Dar es Salaam recently that there are two kinds of drugs that can be packed and posted for moving as parcel from one person to another. He described that the first type of illegal drugs was marijuana which may be grown locally and might be moved through postal services and the other category was those made of chemical like cocaine which may for this case be imported or shipped across the country through post services. “We have so far strengthened security system like setting special scanners which can detect illicit drug which may be parked within the parcel,” he said when closing threeday TPC workers council in Dar es Salaam. He said that TPC employees were also cemented with more knowledge in identifying and reporting illicit drugs from the Tanzanian Drug Control Commission (DCC), the knowledge which is vital as TPC prepares to move its services near to its customers. Mwang’ombe said that TPC plans to give its customers a choice of picking their letters and parcels at the nearest post office or take it to their very own premises paying some little more amount and agents who will be selling soon to be introduced digital letter stamps and collecting letters on behalf of TPC, whereby knowledge on combating drug trafficking came at the right time. “We also collaborate with other security organs to control drug trafficking through our services at the airports, for the incoming parcels and later scan them,” he insisted and added that as of recent, there is no parcel detected with the drugs. The postmaster general directed the TPC workers to put customer service first in their due course and shun from nepotism and all forms of corruption which discourage customers.
