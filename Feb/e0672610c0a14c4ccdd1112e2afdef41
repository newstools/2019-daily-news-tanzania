THE Chinese government has commended Tanzanian court for sentencing the Chinese woman dubbed ‘Queen of Ivory’ to 15 years in jail for ivory smuggling. Reaching the verdict by the Kisutu Resident Magistrate’s Court in Dar es Salaam on the 19th of February this year, the Queen of Ivory, Ms Yang Feng Glan and two others were convicted for leading organised crime related to 860 pieces of elephant tusks, which are government trophies, valued at over 13bn/-. According to online sources, the Deputy Director of Foreign Ministry Information Department of the People’s Republic of China, Mr Geng Shuang stated that China supports the Tanzanian authorities in conducting a ‘just’ investigation and trial. Stressing that, “the Chinese government holds zero tolerance towards the illegal trade of endangered animals and their product and is ready to work with the international community to protect wildlife and curb the international trade.” The prosecution through 11 witnesses sufficiently proved the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt in three offences, affirmed the Principal Resident Magistrate, Ms Huruma Shaidi. The Magistrate also sentenced each of the trio, including Tanzanians Manase Philemon and Salivius Matembo, to either pay a fine of two times the market value of the elephant tusks or go to jail for two years in default of paying for unlawful dealing in the trophies. While sentencing the accused, the magistrate pointed out that the offences committed were very serious and had an adverse impact on the country’s economy and the court would not close its eyes but ensure natural resources are protected and those jeopardising them are punished. In addition to the custodial sentences, the magistrate also ordered the confiscation to the government the farm that was owned by the Chinese national at Mheza in Tanga City, having been proved by the prosecution that it was used to hide the elephant tusks for illegal export outside the country. Mr Shuang said China won’t take sides on its citizens’ criminal activities and that they support Tanzania for dealing with the case in accordance with the laws of the land.
