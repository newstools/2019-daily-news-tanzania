The deputy minister said of the 3,504 industries, 2,500 were small industries, 943 medium industries and 10 others were large industries. Ms Manyanya further said in collaboration with the office of the Treasury Registrar, her ministry was conducting thorough assessment of all 156 privatised industries before recommending what steps should be taken by the government. “In the same assessment, my ministry has taken appropriate measures to 68 industries that are yet to be developed,’’ she added. Ms Manyanya said the office of the Attorney General had satisfied itself with the recommendations and asked the office of the Treasury Registrar to take appropriate measures as stipulated in the law.
