STUDENTS completing computer courses at the Open University of Tanzania (OUT) will now be awarded certificates that approve their skills and knowledge as per standards of International Computer Driving Licence (ICDL). This follows the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between OUT and ICDL, the world's leading computer skills certification, which has kept unified standards for computer literacy testing. At the signing ceremony in Dar es Salaam yesterday, OUT Vice Chancellor, Prof Elifas Bisanda, said the deal cemented cooperation between the two institutions. "We will now have ICDL's accredited testing centre to test skills and knowledge capability of our graduates and award them with certificates," Prof Bisanda said. He explained that the country had many institutions that offered computer courses, but there was no unified standard. "We remain optimistic that the government will incorporate the ICDL standards into the country's laws to make it mandatory for students, who pursue computer courses and seek public jobs," he said. He noted that without having agreed the common level of standards of skills, some people might claim to have pursued computer studies without having requisite skills. "People may claim that they know, while they underutilise the computer...they use it like a typewriter," he said. ICDL Regional Manager, Solange Umulisa said: "We work closely with governments...we are in talks with Tanzania to have the governmentâ€™s endorsement." She thanked OUT for joining the global family of the ICDL, promising to make things easier for the university. Ms Umulisa said every country needed knowledge-based economy, with citizens, who had knowledge and skills to develop the economy. She promised that ICDL would ensure Tanzanians had acquired suitable skills for the market.
