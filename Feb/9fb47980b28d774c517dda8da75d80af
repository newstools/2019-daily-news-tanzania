DAR ES SALAAM City’s master plan is now available for opinions, with city authorities starting collecting public views on the document. Regional Commissioner Paul Makonda yesterday implored the city residents to cooperate with officers deployed to their areas to collect their opinions. Mr Makonda was speaking during a stakeholders meeting in Dar es Salaam during which the city plan was unveiled. He said the document aims at addressing various challenges related to city planning with regard to the rapid increase of population, which leads to unplanned settlements. According to the RC, the city planning challenges have been impeding development. For the first time, Dar es Salaam City Master Plan was launched in 2016, covering a 20-year period to 2036. The plan also contains the city’s various development strategies, including construction of infrastructure. Dr Camilius Lekule, one of the team members who prepared the document, said by 2036, Dar es Salaam is expected to have the same look as the cities of Cairo in Egypt and Lagos in Nigeria. Dr Lekule mentioned some of the means to achieve the plan objectives as development of squatters. “This will help in improving the settlements and improve the building standards required for particular areas,” he said. The Dar es Salaam city is estimated to have between five and six million people and the number is expected to double by 2036. The master plan was therefore designed to cater for the need of population increase and human settlements. Mr Makonda earlier said currently the city faces serious challenge of traffic congestion and unplanned settlements, noting that the city authorities are obliged to transform Dar es Salaam into the best commercial city in East Africa.
