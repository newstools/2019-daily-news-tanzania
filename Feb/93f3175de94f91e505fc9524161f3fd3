DESPITE great strides in the sector of education, Zanzibar is still faced with a congestion of pupils in classrooms, the House was informed yesterday. Legislators heard Deputy Minister for Education and Vocational Training, Mmanga Mjengo Mjawir say that the average number of pupils in a classroom was 82, while in some classrooms they were 188. “The biggest congestion is in the highly populated district of West B, for example, Kinuni Primary School has 188 pupils in class in Kijitoupele 120, Magogoni 104 and Fuoni 104. This is a big load to a teacher because the required ratio is 1:45,” said Mjawir. Mr Rashid Shamsi (Magomeni) and other backbenchers asked the government about efforts made to address the congestion problem in schools. The deputy minister replied: “We are constructing modern buildings and we are sure of having enough classrooms to accommodate all pupils. We are doing our best to solve this problem, including hiring teachers.” He attributed the increase to population growth and the free education policy.
