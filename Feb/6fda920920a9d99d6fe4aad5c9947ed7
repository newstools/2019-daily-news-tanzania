HEARING of the murder case PI No 56/2018 facing two Kibeta Primary School teachers in Bukoba Municipality is expected to start on February 6, this year before Bukoba High Court J udge in-charge, Lameck Mlacha. Deputy Registrar, Ms J oyce Minde, disclosed this recently, while presiding over the launch of Tanzania Law Week held at the High Court premises in Bukoba Municipality. The accused were identified as Respicius Patrick Mutazangirwa (50), and Elieth Patrick (46), both pleaded not guilty to the charges when they appeared in court for preliminary hearing (PH) on October 22, last year. Reading the facts, State Attorney, Ms Chema Maswi, who was assisted by State Attorneys Nestory Nchimani and Juma Mahona alleged before the High Court that on August 27, 2018, in the morning hours, the duo being teachers at Kibeta Primary School, murdered Sperius Eradius (13), who was in Standard Five. She informed the court that on the material date, the second accused (Elieth) arrived at the institution on a motorcycle owned by Emigius Benezeth and carrying several items including a handbag and a thermos flask, where several pupils welcomed her and took her items to the Teachers’ staffroom. After a short time while in school compound, she (Elieth), realised that she had lost her purse that contained her mobile phone and some 75,000/-. At first, she wanted the bodadoda rider to take her back fearing she could have dropped it on the way to school, but she changed her mind and inquired from some of the pupils, who had welcomed her whether they had seen it. In the process, two pupils in Standard Two allegedly named the deceased as the “thief” and Elieth decided to severely punish him, until he unconsciously collapsed.
