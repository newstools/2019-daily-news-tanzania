THE police in Dodoma have arrested four people, who are alleged to have conspired with dishonest officials of Dodoma City Council to interfere with the council’s database to shift ownership of land to other people. Dodoma Regional Police Commander (RPC) Gilles Muroto told a press conference yesterday that the suspects were also implicated in the theft of title deeds and changing the Dodoma City Master Plan’s land use. “The suspects resold land to other people and changed land ownership,” said the RPC. He mentioned the suspects as Mr Jackson Ndahani (58) of Ipagala, Mr Abel Mika (46) of Makole, Mr Elias Stephano (27) of Area A and Mr Shaban Msovela (37) of Area D in Dodoma City. The RPC said police were still investigating the matter to establish an entire syndicate behind the crime, adding that the police were hunting for other people implicated in the matter. In another development, the RPC said the police had impounded 69 slot-machines, which were illegally operated in pubs in various parts of Dodoma City. He added that the force had arrested nine people in connection with the incident. “Most of the slot-machines have been operated illegally due to lack of official registration,” he noted. Mr Muroto said most of the business operators, who owned the slot-machines, were found without permits to run the business, saying other business operators were found with permits to run the business in other regions. “Some suspects were found with a permit to run one slot-machine, but they were operating more than one slot machine,” he explained. Meanwhile, the police are holding four suspects over forgery of Electronic Fiscal Device (EFD) receipts in various parts of Dodoma City. The RPC named the suspects as Mr Badi Mushi (25), Mr Jerome Mushi (27) and Mr Alif Abdallah (23), all residents of Nzuguni in the city and Mr Awadhi Suleiman (27) from Makole.
