TANZANIAN manufacturers of cosmetics have been encouraged to take advantage of upcoming China International Beauty Expo (CIBE) to be held in Guangzhou, China, at which they can learn new technology and formulas for making such products. Organisers said yesterday that they now focus on linking beauty industry in Africa and China, taking into account the long existed relationship between China and Africa. Vice-President of the African General Chamber of Commerce (AGCC), Mr Rex Chan, told members of the press yesterday in Dar es Salaam that the next CIBE is scheduled for next month and it is a step towards linking the beauty industry in China and Africa. “In the future we will bring the Chinese cosmetics manufacturers to Tanzania to explore market opportunity and beauty trend so that they could decide to establish factories here,” Mr Rex stated. He said the African cosmetics manufacturers also have potential market in Guangzhou since there is a lot of African residents in that Chinese City. The CIBE has relationship with at least 5 0 beauty industries in China that are expected to participate during the expo. Another official with the CIBE, Mr Haifan Zhang, explained that they look forward to expanding the expo to Africa since 80 per cent of the expo participants were from China. Mr Haifan assured of bringing genuine Chinese cosmetics manufacturers to avoid bringing substandard products to Tanzania.
