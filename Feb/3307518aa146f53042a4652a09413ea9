VICE-PRESIDENT Samia Suluhu Hassan has implored wananchi across the country to stop disturbing investors in their areas to enable them conduct their activities efficiently. “Don’t attack investors, embrace them because they are supposed to pay some levies to villages where they operate, benefiting the host village through various social infrastructures as the investor excels,” the Vice President stated. She was speaking at Mang’onyi village dispensary, which was built by the citizens using money they had been paid as compensation to relocate to pave way for gold mining project by the mining investor. “When there is peace and good relation between investors and residents, it gives us (government) an opportunity to implement development projects,” she said. Meanwhile, Ms Samia directed the Deputy Minister for Water, Mr Jumaa Aweso, to ensure that Mang’onyi villagers in Ikungi District in Singida region get water to relieve them from water woes. She noted that for a long time the villagers have been facing acute water shortage. She however said the government has allocated funds to drill 20 water wells during this fiscal year to supply them with clean and safe water.
