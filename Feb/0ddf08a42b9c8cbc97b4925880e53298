THE Kisutu Resident Magistrate’s Court in Dar es Salaam yesterday warned sureties, who bailed out Singida East Member of Parliament (MP) Tundu Lissu in a criminal trial he is facing, for failure to report his whereabouts for over eight months. Principal Resident Magistrate Thomas Simba gave such warning when the two sureties, Ibrahim Hamadi and Robert Katula, positively responded to the court’s directives of attending the court session to show cause why bail should not be cancelled to the accused. Both sureties tendered their apologies to the court for failure to execute their duties effectively as required by law, notably ensuring the accused attends court sessions whenever needed. But one of them was quick to inform the court that Lissu had defaulted attending his case because he is sick. Mr Hamadi explained that “the accused is still attending treatments in Belgium and he received the 23rd operation on February 20, 2019.” However, the prosecution, led by State Attorney Wankyo Simon, could not buy the explanations given by the sureties. “The accused (Lissu) is seen rooming around in different European and American countries. The surety has not told us which hospital the accused is been attended. If it pleases, your honour, this court should issue arrest warrant against him as it appeared he is not in hospital,” the trial attorney requested. In his short order, however, the magistrate has this to say, “The request to issue arrest warrant to the accused is rejected. Sureties are hereby warned to discharge their duties as required. You are required to know your obligations towards the accused, as about eight months have passed he is not attending.”
