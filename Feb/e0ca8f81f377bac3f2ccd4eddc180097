THE Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) Parents’ wing has condemned the cruelty of women who dump babies after delivery. The wing’s Mbulu District Chairperson, Ms Zainabu Sige, said here recently that the organisation was disturbed by the tendency, attributing it to lack of proper parenting. She was speaking in the wake of the cruel action by a girl aged 23, who drowned a baby in a bucket of water shortly after delivery, and subsequently dumped it on an anthill. “As a parents’ wing, we condemn the cruelty. Even if she was frustrated for some reason, she should have placed the baby in a mosque or a church, to facilitate rescue by Good Samaritans,” said Ms Sige. The baby dumper who is now in police custody was reportedly stressed over persistent pressure by her parents to disclose who the baby’s would-have-been father was. The Manyara Regional Police Commander (RPC), Mr Augustino Senga confirmed the incident, saying that upon being questioned, the suspect said that hardships had led her into the decision. RPC Senga said investigations into the incident were still underway, and upon completion, the suspect would be arraigned.
