THE government has been advised to enact a law and regulations to regulate medicinal herbs and prepare genetic data of all traditional medicines for research activities. The director of Institute of Traditional Medicine of Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (Muhas), Dr Joseph Otieno, told the ‘Daily News’ in Dar es Salaam yesterday that the law would help recognise people who took medicinal herbs without permission from the government, especially foreigners. “It is true that medicinal herbs have been taken and used contrary to law. If the government formulates a proper law that prohibits the production of medicinal herbs without permission, our plants will be protected. Traditional medicine is very important in human life,” Dr Otieno said. A two-year research, entitled ‘Identification of traded medicinal plants of Tanzania by using DNA bar-coding’ funded by the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology (Costech) realises that there are some medicinal herbs taken and used improperly without the permission of the responsible authorities. He said it had been also revealed that many people involved in traditional medicine were hardly aware of the negative effects on human health. “Nowadays many people do this business, but they are not aware of the negative effects on human health,” he said. He noted that the aim of the project was to identify where medicinal herbs were mostly found in the country to improve the production of traditional medicine for the benefit of Tanzanians.
