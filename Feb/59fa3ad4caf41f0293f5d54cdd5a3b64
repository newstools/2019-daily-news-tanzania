STRONG demand for the USD in the local market and seasonal drought of foreign inflows put the shilling on a long standing pressure. According to CRDB Bank Financial Market Highlights, on Monday the shilling continued its trend of suffering a long standing pressure from the USD. Last week, the shilling slightly depreciated on the Interbank Foreign Exchange Market (IFEM) as for the first time since mid-December the amount transacted exceeded one million per trading session. According to the Weekly Financial Markets Synopsis, the shilling depreciated by a mere 0.02 per cent to close the week at a weighted average exchange rate of 2,294.95/USD compared to 2,294.41/USD posted in the previous week. The total amount traded weekly on the IFEM has been on a consecutive rise since late December, with the week under review posting 5.55 million US dollars which is 53 per cent higher than 3.62 million US dollars posted in the previous week. The visible pressure on the shilling pushed the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) to issue a statement pointing out probable reasons for the pressure being a seasonal drought of foreign inflows in the period of January to April since in the period there are neither viable traditional exports nor significant tourism activities. In the same light, the government secured a buyer for 100,000 tonnes of cashew nuts. The buyer, a Kenyan firm known as Indo Power Solutions Limited will pay more than 180 million US dollars for the cashews, a significant boost to foreign reserves that have been falling since August 2018 according to BoTâ€™s monthly economic reviews.
