TANZANIA Tourist Board (TTB) and Rejoy International Holding company Limited of China have signed a strategic cooperation agreement, to organise an international boxing tournament in Arusha Region in July this year. Speaking after signing the agreement at the TTB offices in Dar es Salaam yesterday, the Senior Vice-President of Rejoy company, Andrew LU said the tournament will involve 40 to 50 boxers of separate weights from the East African zone, China, Japan, Thailand, South and North Korea, Philippine, Zambia and Ghana. He said the tournament will involve male and female boxers and will be held at Sheikh Amri Abeid Memorial Stadium in Arusha. “The event will not only strengthen cooperation between Tanzania and China but will also help to improve boxing skills. It will help to promote sport tourism,” he said. According to him, the two-day tournament will include live conference that will involve separate international speakers and the topics that would be discussed in the forum are about economic development. TTB Chairman, Thomas Mihayo said the event would provide an opportunity to promote sport and conference tourism, which is not common in Tanzania. “We want to increase the number of tourists coming to the country, and if we are able to get at least 1,000 tourists from China and other countries in the next three years, it will be a great opportunity,” he said. However, he said that he was optimistic the number would increase especially taking into consideration that in 2017, the number was 1.3 million visitors overall. Adding that, they are yet to set projections for 2019, as they are still waiting to get figures of tourists who visited Tanzania in 2018. The management of Rejoy Group arrived in the country last Sunday and visited Arusha to observe the environment and to inspect the Sheikh Amri Abeid Memorial Stadium to see the possibilities to rehabilitate the venue for the coming boxing competition.
