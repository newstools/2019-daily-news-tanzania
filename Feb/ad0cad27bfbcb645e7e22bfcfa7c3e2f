NKASI District Commissioner (DC) in Rukwa Region Said Mtanda has expressed his concern over a shortage of medicine and medical equipment such as injection syringes at Nkomolo Health Centre in Namanyere Town. Accordingly, Mr Mtanda directed Nkasi District Council Executive Director (DED), Missana Kwangula to monitor the district health department and find out why the health facility is facing such a shortage of medicine. Addressing the Nkasi District Full Council meeting in the district, the DC said he was surprised by report that the council was not indebted to Medical Stores Department (MSD). "Iâ€™m the district health committee's chairman, but to my surprise I have no any knowledge and nobody has told me about the shortage of medicine and injection syringes facing Nkomolo Health Centre and that the council is not indebted to MSD," added the DC. "Two days ago I made a surprise visit at Nkomolo Health Centre and I was shocked to witness more than 60 patients, who had been waiting for eight hours to be attended to. They told me that they had been waiting for eight hours since 8:00am to 4:00pm... it is disheartening because the health facility has six qualified medical doctors and six rooms for medical consultation," said the DC. He reminded councillors during the full council meeting that the government had spent 500m/- on the rehabilitation of Nkomolo Health Centre. Meanwhile, councillors unanimously endorsed the 2019/20 budget of 40,058,509,641/-. Presenting the plan and budget proposal for 2019/29 year, Nkasi District Council Planning Officer, Reuben Sanga told the meeting that 36,214,085,932 /- was a grant from the central government and 23,843,582,600/- was salary for civil servants. "The council estimates to collect and spend 2.3bn/-," added Mr Sanga.
