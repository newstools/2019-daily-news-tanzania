Presenting the committee comments on the 2018/2019 government performance/programme implementation as regards laws, and good governance, Mr Machano Othman Said, Chairperson of the committee said the conflict between Police and anti-corruption, separate public institutions demoralises people’s on the institutions. “This incident should be investigated and action taken so it never happens again. All public institutions should work closely, particularly the police and the anti-corruption authority in fighting crime including corruption,” he said. It has been alleged that last week armed police officers ambushed the ‘Zanzibar Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Authority (ZAECA) offices at Vuga, beating up some staffs, to show unhappiness against the way anti-corruption officers are handling a bribe case on their colleague.
