PARLIAMENT business came to a standstill yesterday after all legislators escaped for their dear lives following a fire alarm in the house. The chairperson of the morning parliamentary session, Najma Giga who was presiding the meeting had to break the morning session over the incident and all MPs walked out of the debating chamber. It was during the question-answer session at around 11am when the gadget started giving loud alarming sound. For about 30 minutes, the distressed MPs gathered outside the August House as the officers of the Fire Brigade stormed the debating chamber to find the source of the alarm. At around 11:30am, the legislators were called to return to the house after the situation came under control. The session continued at around 12 noon, with Speaker Job Ndugai taking over the chair and concluding the question- answer session. Some of the lawmakers who spoke to the ‘Daily News’ over the incident said they were in tension. Tanda MP Musa Mbarouk thanked the technology, saying with installed fire alarm they managed to take precaution by going out of the house. “We are now waiting for assurance if the danger has been forestalled,” he said. Mr James Mbatia (Vunjo- NCCR) said the incident was a wakeup call to strengthen disaster preparedness education to MPs. “This is because almost all of us are dispersed here outside instead of gathering at specific assembly point,” he noted with concern.
