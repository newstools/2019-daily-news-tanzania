TANZANIA will assume the status of the “guest country” at China-Africa Economic and Trade Expo, an event scheduled for Changsha, the capital of central China’s Hunan Province, in June this year. The expo is part of the promises made by Chinese President Xi Jinping (pictured) at last September’s Forum on China–Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) summit in Beijing. During his speech to African leaders, President Xi proposed eight initiatives aimed at pursuing a win-win situation strategy giving new impetus to economic, political and security collaboration. During the FOCAC summit, President Xi promised to increase imports from Africa, promote African products, exempt some poorer African countries from debt as well as exempt least developed African companies from paying exhibition fees at its annual high-level China International Import Expo. “We have decided to open a China-Africa economic and trade expo in China. W e encourage Chinese companies to increase investment in Africa and will build and upgrade a number of economic and trade cooperation zones in Africa. We will support Africa in achieving general food security by 2030, work with Africa to formulate and implement a programme of action to promote China-Africa cooperation on agricultural modernisation,” President Xi was quoted as saying during the FOCAC summit last year. Currently, China is Africa’s largest trading partner.
