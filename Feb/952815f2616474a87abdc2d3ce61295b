ENTREPRENEURS in Kagera Region have been advised to utilise services rendered by the Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) as a way to penetrate wider market and fetch attractive prices for their products. TBS Public Relations Officer, Ms Neema Mtemvu made the remarks here yesterday when conducting sensitisation education in Bukoba Municipality. “We work closely with the Small Industries Development Organisation (SIDO) where entrepreneurs can access necessary accreditation,” she said. Expounding, she noted that TBS does not ban products from neighbouring country but insisted that such products should bear the country’s Bureau of Standards mark. She was responding to questions raised following reports that fake products were entering the country urging people to report culprits to TBS for necessary action. Ms Mtemvu elaborated that TBS had its office at Mutukula border adding that TBS was keen to assist entrepreneurs to increase their business skills and expand their markets.
