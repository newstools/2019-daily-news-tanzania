TANZANIA Trade Development Authority (TanTrade) will facilitate introduction of an association for bringing cassava farmers and processors together, in order to improve productivity. The envisaged association is aimed at ensuring that Tanzania reaps huge profits from the world market, largely China, according to the Director General of TanTrade, Mr Edwin Rutageruka. “The main goal of the association will be to improve production of cassava as well as additional value for stem tubers in order to penetrate the world market,” he told reporters here over the weekend. According to the TanTrade DG, the association which is expected to operate under the supervision of Tan Trade, will work round the clock to ensure cassava growers get access to needed farming inputs. “The association will facilitate training for cassava farmers and processors on agronomic practices,” he said. While demand for cassava in Tanzania grows, the country’s annual production level remains at 6.8 million tonnes. Tanzania is the twelfth largest producer of cassava crop in the world and the sixth after Nigeria, DRC, Ghana, Angola and Mozambique in Africa. The sub-sector employs a total of 1.3 million smallholder farmers in the country, whereby between 2012 and 2006, a total of 59,447,754 tonnes of cassava was produced and sold abroad. Following increased demand for cassava in the world, a number of Chinese companies are eying to chip in the country and invest into cassava processing industries. They include Epoch Agriculture, Foshang Guangji Co. Ltd and Dar Canton Co. Ltd. Regions with ideal climate for cassava farming in the country are Mwanza, Mara, Kagera, Shinyanga, Lindi, Morogoro, Tanga, Dar es Salaam, Coast, Kigoma, Singida and Dodoma.
