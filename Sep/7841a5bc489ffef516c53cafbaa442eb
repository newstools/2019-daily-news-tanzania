FOREIGN Affairs and East African Cooperation Minister, Prof Palamagamba Kabudi, has said agricultural revolution is needed if the country is to achieve and sustain industrial development. Speaking in Dar es Salaam yesterday, Prof Kabudi challenged the youth to use their knowledge, skills and innovation to bring about agricultural revolution in the country. “We need to revolutionise the agricultural sector because it’s the only sector, which provides employment to the majority of the nation’s population,” he said. He insisted that agricultural revolution would result in productivity and high production. Prof Kabudi said this, when biding farewell to students travelling to Israel for building capacity in agriculture. The minister said the revolution would also see the country’s industrialisation flourish by producing raw materials that would feed industries. On the other hand, the minister said the students were going to Israel to learn by doing, gain experience from Israel and later return home and use the skills, knowledge and innovation gained in improving and making changes in the agricultural sector. Despite it being a semi-arid country, the minister said Israel was one of the countries that had recorded major success in the agricultural sector through investing in it and having innovation skills. He said there was a need for the students to learn and adapt the methods and technologies used by Israel in farming and later apply them in Tanzania for the benefit of the nation. One hundred out of 1,040 students, who applied for an 11-month programme on building capacity in agriculture in Israel, would leave today. Prof Kabudi called on those, who missed the chance not to give up as the government would plan more fruitful training in capacity building in agriculture in the country.
