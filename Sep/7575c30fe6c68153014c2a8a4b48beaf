SPEAKER of the National Assembly Job Ndugai has launched a fund raising campaign to raise money for the Maternity Ward at St Lukes Health Centre located in Mpwapwa District, asking more stakeholders to pump in funds for its construction. Speaking after leading a procession of health stakeholders for the fund raising function held in Dodoma, Mr Ndugai said the Anglican Church of Tanzania was among the institutions that were contributing immensely to the health sector, asking other institutions to follow suit. “I wish to urge stakeholders, institutions and individuals to support the Anglican Church in supporting the health sector, not only at St Luke’s but also see how best we can construct a referral hospital which will offer exclusive services for cancer related complications,’’ he said. The Speaker said completion of a referral hospital would help people to have access to cancer treatment which is offered at very few health facilities. “When the construction is completed, it will be a blessing in disguise because many people have been suffering and getting hurdles in accessing medical services, especially on cancer treatment whose costs are high,’’ he said. St Luke’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr Edwin Kiula, said his centre had five different departments, including that of maternity, where services at that department ought to be provided freely in accordance with directives from the health ministry. According to him, statistics at the centre indicate that the Outpatients Department (OPD), received about 8,000 patients per year while there were18,000. Dr Kiula added that women who delivered safely per year were 400 while those who underwent cesarean section surgery were 250 while those who were admitted were 500
