BANCABC has launched a new bank account with simplified opening requirements aimed at enabling more people access banking services. The Head of Retail and Commercial Banking at BancABC which is part of Atlas Mara Tanzania, Joyce Malai said in Dar es Salaam yesterday that getting assurance of prosperity in business is key in today’s world, making many people cautious about their return in investment. “Today in the market, many are looking for safe opportunities to invest their money and get assured results,” she said, adding that this is why BancABC introduced a zero monthly maintenance charges account dubbed IZZE account that will reward customers on monthly basis. To open this account, she said a customer will only need a National Identification Card (NIDA) and will earn interest from a balance of just 10,000/- monthly. Furthermore, BancABC has worked on a simple solution by introducing the IZZE account proposition which can be performed at the customer’s door step and bank’s agents countrywide. The Agency Banking Manager at BancABC , Mr Mwita Rhobi, said the bank has approved its agents countrywide to assist with document collection for opening new accounts digitally. According to 2017 Fin- Scope Survey, only 16.9 per cent of Tanzanians have bank accounts and World Bank data reveals that around 2.5 billion people in the world do not use formal financial services and 75 per cent of poor people do not have bank accounts. The 2018 Global Findex Database on the other hand shows that globally, 69 percent of adults, 3.8 billion people now have an account at a bank or mobile money provider. This is up from 62 percent in 2014 and just 51 percent in 2011. It is against this background and in the spirit of working closely with the government to drive financial inclusion in the country and meeting customer needs, that through the launch of the new account, Tanzanians can own this account and enjoy interest every month.
