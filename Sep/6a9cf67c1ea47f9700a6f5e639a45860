THE Tanzania Football Federation (TFF), said it will fully cooperate with Special Olympics Tanzania (SO-T), to ensure that the objectives of Play Unified, Learn Unified project are fulfilled. This was said yesterday by the federation's Technical Director, Oscar Milambo to the SO-T delegation, which visited him at his office in Dar es Salaam, for the purpose of briefing the federation about the initiative. “It is good that the project target to promote inclusive way of living between intellectual disabled people and their normal colleagues through engaging them in sports activities. This is a good gesture and we will give you our support where it is needed,” Milambo said. Earlier, SO-T National Director Charles Rays said the main reason to come up with the project whose main donor is Stavros Niarchos Foundation (SNF), is to show the world that people with intellectual disabilities can equally contribute positively in social and economic development if they are included in such activities. “The world is now advocating inclusive culture whereby all people are treated in the same manner regardless of their biological differences," he said. He added that research has shown that intellectual challenged people learn fast important skills if they participate in sports hence time is here for parents and guardians of people who are intellectual challenged to let them go out and play with their friends to establish friendship. The Play Unified, Learn Unified initiative which is expected to run for three years has seen its first phase targeting five primary schools from five regions of Mwanza, Tanga, Morogoro, Mtwara and Dar es Salaam. In each region, ten coaches from the picked schools have been drilled with basic skills on how to implement the initiative once it starts rolling soon.
