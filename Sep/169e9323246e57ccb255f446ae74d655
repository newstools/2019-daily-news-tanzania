THE National Bank of Commerce (NBC) has called upon the Tanzania Truck Owners Association (TATOA) to utilize its newly introduced business insurance loan product that will help them overcome risks that can emerge in the line of their daily operations. Speaking at the TATOA’s 2019 Annual General Meeting held in Dar es Salaam over the weekend, NBC’s Director of Business Bank Elvis Ndunguru said the new product introduced about a month ago, has loans ranging from 1m/- to 3bn/-offered at all bank branches across the country. Beneficiaries are liable to repay only two months of their annual and the rest of the months will be covered by NBC on their behalf, he said. NBC has so far remitted 5bn/- in a short period since the product came to market and about 20,000 beneficiaries are targeted in this scheme as of the end of December, he said. He said that the product is meant to support government’s initiatives in strengthening the transportation sector for economic growth. “The loans are available at an affordable interest rate you don’t need a collateral to secure the insurance loan,” he told TATOA members. On the other hand, he said the bank has been working hand in hand with the government through its electronic payment system to enable the public make payments to public institutions. More than 100 public institutions are working with NBC in this way. He said the same payments can be made through over more than 2000 agents across the country. However, more than NBC’s 2500 points of sales are connected to the government payment system. The Minister of Works, Transport and Communications Engineer Isack Kamwele, who graced the event, said NBC is playing its part to the fullest in the financial sector. “NBC used to work closely with large enterprises but now is going for the semi and mid entrepreneurs. We have signed already a MoU with the bank that allows them to have their shops in all offices of the Tanzania Posta Corporation across the country,” said the minister.
