THE National Electoral Commission (NEC) is calling upon Tanzanians who have attained 18 years and above to turn out in big numbers and register with Biometric Voters’ Register (BVR) when the exercise kicks off on November 2, this year. The appeal was made in Bukoba Municipal Council by NEC Commissioner, Ms Asina Omari, while opening a sensitisation voters’ workshop, yesterday further asking Kagera Region residents not to take the exercise for granted. She said that those eligible for registration would be those born before October 2002, or would be 18 years next year, adding that it would include those who have moved to other new areas or lost their voters cards. The Commissioner noted that the registration was mainly for Presidential, Parliamentary and Councilors only and not for local government elections. However, the number of registration centres in the region increased from 1,665 in 2015 to 1,678 this year. The Voters’ Registration exercise was re-launched on July 18 this year in Kilimanjaro and to date has spread wings to seven others regions of Arusha, Manyara, Simiyu, Mara, Geita, Shinyanga and Mwanza. In a related development, Ms Omari urged the residents who might have been bereaved as from October 2015 to date to report the deaths to their nearest registration centres to enable NEC delete the names of their dead relatives from the Permanent Voters’ Register (PVR).
