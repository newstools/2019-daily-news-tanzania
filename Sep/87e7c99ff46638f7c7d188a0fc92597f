EAST African youth have every reason to smile as the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA) is set to debate and enact the EAC Youth Council Bill, 2017 during its first Meeting of the third session which started here yesterday. The Bill is expected to befit the youth who make a significant percentage of the populace in the EAC region a great deal. Moved by Ugandan lawmaker Susan Nakawuki, the Bill is premised on Article 120 of the EAC Treaty and seeks to implement the EAC Youth Policy 2014, which is an integral part of the fourth EAC Development Strategy 2011/12 – 2015/16. The Bill, which sailed through the First Reading on May 31, 2017, recognizes that partner states have diverse laws and policies regarding the youth in their territories. It also seeks to harmonise the laws and regulations pertaining to youth in the Community while providing for a suitable legal framework. The Bill also seeks to establish the East African Youth Council within the EAC to provide for the composition, objects and functions, administration, finances and to provide for other related matters. Also on the agenda for consideration at this session which extends to October 5 this year, will be a number of reports that emanate from workings of various Committees. For instance, the report of the Committee on Regional Affairs and Conflict Resolution on the oversight for proliferation of small arms and light weapons is set to be considered during EALA’s sessions. This follows an activity of the Committee undertaken from August 25 to 29 in Nairobi, Kenya in collaboration with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The assembly is also set to receive a report by the Committee on General Purpose on the oversight activity that sought to assess the level of preparedness of Partner States in management of Ebola and Dengue Fever outbreaks.
