Tanzanian youth and women are advised to appear in large numbers to contest for various positions in local government elections, expected to take place on November 24 this year. The call was made today Wednesday, September 25 by the Youth Special Seat Representative Zainab Katimba when she visited Tanzania Standard Newspapers (TSN) main offices in Dar es Salaam. “Women and youth don’t stay behind, be part of decision-making opportunities and the process of developing your communities," she said. She further called citizens at large to show up and vote for the leaders who will genuinely foster development in their respective areas.
