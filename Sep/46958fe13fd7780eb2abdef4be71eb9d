AT least 2,000 pupils from 12 schools in Dar es Salaam have gone through safety and security training offered by one of the oldest security companies in the country, SGA. The company has been offering the training for the past one week as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), in marking its 35 years of operations in Tanzania. Speaking yesterday in the city during a seminar to its corporate customers, SGA Managing Director, Eric Sambu said the training to students covered issues of fire, first aid, environment, health, and general security. The SGA is the oldest private security company in Tanzania, having started its operations in 1984 as Group Four Security, and presently employs over 5,800 Tanzanians based in their sites countrywide. Participants of yesterday's seminar commended SGA for observing the country's rules and regulations in training, vetting, supervision and salaries to employees. The participants urged other security companies to follow suit. The company has over 80 employees who have worked for the company for more than 20 years, while employees who have served for over 10 years are about 2,200. "SGA was the first company to operate as a private security company in Tanzania, and it has proven that taking care of staff is the key to success in security business," Mr Sambu said. He explained that the company is celebrating its anniversary in Tanzania and has witnessed tremendous growth, especially in the last five years. He attributed the achievement to revolution of their internal processes to empower his team to perform well in all sectors and surpass customers' expectations. He said the company focuses on investing more in technology to keep itself more competitive.
