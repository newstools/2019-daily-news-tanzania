THE government has asked research and academic institutions to capitalise on thorough studies that will bring evidence-based results on the policies and projects currently being undertaken in the health sector. The Director of Health Services at the President’s Office, Regional Administration and Local Government, Dr Ntuli Kapologwe said here yesterday that various researches, if carried out properly, would help in policy frameworks as well as help in assessment of various development projects in the health sector. He was speaking when officiating the opening of the third Annual Health Monitoring and Evaluation Best Practices Conference which was organised and coordinated by the Centre of Excellence in Health Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) at Mzumbe University. The three-day conference which comes to an end tomorrow is expected to include individual oral presentations, plenary sessions, poster presentations, and master’s thesis presentations from students in the Masters of Science in Health Monitoring and Evaluation offered by Mzumbe University. According to Dr Kapologwe, the conference themed ‘Enhancing Data Quality and Creating a Culture of Data Use for Health Programme Planning and Improvement’ should help the government in assessing various projects in the health sector. “In our ministry, we have established a special Research and Publication unit which has been working closely with Ifakara Health Institute and different Higher Learning Institutions including Mzumbe University,’’ he said.
