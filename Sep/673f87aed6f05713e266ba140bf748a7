KAGERA Regional Commissioner (RC), Brig Gen Marco Gaguti has appealed to the area residents to regularly drink milk, because it has a complete diet. "People should change attitude and consume more milk regularly, especially children aged five years and below for their brains to develop,” he added. However, he told them to be alter on the source of milk they drink, saying that some of their containers and storage may be poor and result into contamination. “You should be watchful and instead drink milk from authorized milk processing plants to avoid contracting diseases including Tuberculosis (TB),” he added. The RC noted that a national survey conducted last year revealed that Kagera Region was on top out of ten areas in Mainland Tanzania, where malnutrition stands at 39 percent mostly on children aged five years and below. Other regions include Dodoma, Mwanza, Kigoma,Mbeya, Dar es Salaam, Geita, Tabora, Ruvuma and Lindi. He said that with the realization, parents, especially women should be educated on the importance of early breastfeeding. “There is urgent need to reduce the prevalence of malnutrition in the region especially in the first 1000 days of a child's life. This is the time when the brain develops rapidly and would lay him/her a good foundation,” pointed out Brig Gen Gaguti. Expounding, he said that while the national milk consumption averagely stands at 47 litres per year, the regional milk intake rotates at only 16 litres per year against the global expectation of 200 litres per year average. In a related development, the RC said that milk production increased from 43,915,266 litres during 2014/15 to 46,858,481 litres during 2015/216. Between July–December last year milk production stood at 21,141,709 litres, attributing the trend to a prolonged dry spell that hit the region, adding that the region has a total of 21,438 dairy cattle. In the course, Brig Gen Gaguti hinted that Tanzania is implementing a plan to invest in milk consumption from the current 47 litres per person annually to 60 litres in 2018 and 100 litres by 2025.
