DEPUTY Minister for Works, Transport and Communications, Elias Kwandikwa, has assured contractors undertaking various public projects for the government of its commitment to pay them on time because the money is available. He equally urged people to pay taxes, assuring them that each cent will be utilized to the maximum to speed up development. Mr Kwandikwa made the remarks when he inspected several ongoing road projects in Muleba and Missenyi districts. The Deputy Minister who is on a three-day tour noted that the 5th phase government under President John Magufuli was keen to improve infrastructure like roads and bridges, especially along border regions, including Kagera Region. "This will attract investment opportunities, including foreign markets. The roads will also ease transport of people and goods," he said. Earlier, he inspected the ongoing construction of the road linking Muhutwe-Kamachumu to Nshamba and Kanyambogo- Rubya road, in Muleba District. Later in the afternoon, he inspected the 140 metre Kitengule Bridge and its 18-kms approach roads in Missenyi District. The project is expected to cost about 25.4bn/-upon completion. Engineer Lucas Nyaki, a Consultant under Luptan Consult Ltd, informed the Deputy Minister that the road construction works had attained 26.9 per cent performance while construction of the bridge had achieved 22 per cent performance.
