NATIONAL Under-20 side will be looking for their second consecutive victory as they face Kenya in CECAFA U-20 group B match at FUFA Technical Centre Njeru in Jinja, Uganda today. Ngorongoro Heroes launched their campaign with a resounding 4-0 victory over Ethiopia at the same venue on Sunday. Andrew Albert (pictured) netted a hat-trick and Kelvin John in a one sided encounter. Under the tutelage of Zuberi Katwila, the National Under-20 football team looked very superior to their opponents in attacking and defending sections, a situation that helped them stamp a voluminous victory yesterday. The players seemed to be tailor-made for victory courtesy of weeks of serious drills in the camp prior to the tournamentâ€™s kick off. However, it will be not an easy ride as Kenya also started strongly as they posted a 5-0 win over Zanzibar at the same venue on Sunday. Kariobangi Sharks forward Sydney Lokale scored quadruple before Austin Otieno netted the fifth for Coach Stanley Okumbi's team. Ngorongoro Heroes will wind up their group campaign against compatriots Zanzibar on Thursday. Ngorongoro Heroes are pooled in group B alongside compatriots Zanzibar, Ethiopia and Kenya. Ethiopia won the tournament in 2005. Meanwhile, Eritrea and Sudan battled to a 3-3 in their group A match at the Pece War Memorial Stadium in Gulu yesterday. The day also witnessed host Uganda thrashing Djibouti 5-1. This tournament which is funded by Federation of International Football Association (FIFA) will climax on October 5th this year.
