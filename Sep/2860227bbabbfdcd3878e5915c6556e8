AAR Insurance Tanzania Limited has offered free consultation and medical check-ups to their brokers in Dar es Salaam, a move aimed at strengthening their relationship. The medical check-ups included blood pressure, consultations on Stress and Finance Management, Hepatitis B and nutrition. AAR Sales and Marketing Manager, Ms Tabia Massudi observed that most of the brokers require knowledge on how to manage both their physical and mental health for the betterment of their lives and business. “As key players in healthcare, we believe it is our duty to provide our stakeholders with information and medical assistance that will benefit both their physical and mental health. “We recognise the great role our brokers play to the growth of AAR and we are obliged to keep them healthy that is why we are spending half a day today to conduct this exercise, not only to sensitize them on regularly checking their health but also giving them guidance on mental health,” she added. One of the brokers who received both consultation and medical check-up from the health insurance company, Doctor, Sara Nyero from ARIS Brokers expressed gratitude and commended AAR for the initiative. “On behalf of all the brokers, I would like to extend my appreciation to AAR Insurance for both consultation and medical services they have provided us with. We have learnt a lot through the knowledge we acquired today as it is very beneficial to our physical and mental health. I would also like to congratulate them for this initiative that shows that they care. I do believe this will as well strengthen our relationship and make us good ambassadors for the Wellness programme services,” she said.
