AURIC Air plane crash at Serengeti National Park claimed lives of two young pilots, yesterday morning. The deceased are Nelson Mabeyo, a son of Chief of Defence Forces General Venance Mabeyo, and Nelson Ulotu. “Young Mabeyo was the pilot and Ulotu was the co-pilot…they almost have the same age but Mabeyo is 24 years old,” Serengeti District Commissioner (DC) Nurdin Babu told the ‘Daily News’ over a phone interview from the crash scene yesterday afternoon. Accompanied by doctors and members of the district defence and security committee, the DC rushed to Seronera airstrip where the plane crashed while taking off. It was only the pilot and the co-pilot who were on board, he said. “Doctors have seen their bodies and we are now waiting for a chopper to come and pick the body of Mabeyo, the body of Ulotu will be transported from here by Auric Air plane,” said the district chief. The plane crashed while taking off to Kirawila airstrip where it was expected to pick up tourists, Mr Babu said. Tanzania National Parks (TANAPA) confirmed the crash through a tweeter yesterday morning.
