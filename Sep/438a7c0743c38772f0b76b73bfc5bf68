THE Speaker of the National Assembly, Job Ndugai has congratulated three Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) legislators, who recently sought forgiveness from President John Magufuli at intervals after slandering him as the Head of State. Recently, President Magufuli pardoned Mtama Member of Parliament (MP) and former Minister for Information, Culture, Arts and Sports Nape Nnauye and previous Minister of State in the Vice President’s Office, January Makamba as well as past Minister for Energy and Minerals William Ngejela over “what occurred in the past.” “I would like to congratulate Nape (Nnauye), January (Makamba) and (William) Ngeleja for asking for forgiveness from President Magufuli over what happened in the past. To ask for forgiveness is a good thing,” said the Speaker, after question and answers session in Parliament yesterday. “It is not easy to say sorry and many people have failed even when it is too obvious that they erred and needed to ask for forgiveness. Therefore, you have done a good thing and I congratulate you and advice other politicians to emulate you,” said Mr Ndugai. Last week the President said that he had pardoned Makamba (Bumbuli, CCM) and Ngejela (Sengerema, CCM), who had maligned him, adding that the duo were remorseful for their oversight. And this week he announced to have forgiven Mr Nnauye, who went to State House to ask for forgiveness.
