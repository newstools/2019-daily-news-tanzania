A DELEGATION of 40 players is heading to Kampala ahead of the Uganda Open Darts Championship starting a shootout tomorrow in the Ugandan capital. The two-day tournament that has attracted top players from East Africa will climax on Sunday, according to the organizers. Players of the Tanzanian team heading to Uganda have been picked from Arusha, Kagera, Mbeya, Mwanza, Tabora, Morogoro, Kilimanjaro and Dar es Salaam regions. Tanzania will participate in men singles, women singles, men doubles, women doubles and mixed doubles categories. Others to participate in the bi-annual event are players from Kenya, hosts Uganda and Rwanda who will be making a debut as participatory observers. Tanzania Darts Association (TADA) secretary Victor Kimambo said Tanzania performed well in the previous tournaments held in Kilimanjaro and with the new team and additional players from armed forces units Tanzania is well-positioned to conquer this yearâ€™s competition. In the previous round of the East African Darts Championship held in Moshi, Kilimanjaro, Tanzania emerged the overall winner in the event. Adding, he said his association intends to organize an extraordinary Darts tournament in Arusha next month as an event to drill players for Kenya Open Darts Championship to be staged in Nairobi in November. For many years, Arusha has been the doyenne of darts in the country.
