TAIFA Stars skipper Mbwana Samatta admitted that his Belgium side, K.R.C Genk is the underdog in their group E of UEFA Champions League (UCL) pack. They have been placed in the same group together with defending champions Liverpool of England, Napoli (Italy) and FC Salzburg (Austria). Reacting to this development, Samatta, who will become the first Tanzanian to play in UEFA Champions League said there is no doubt that his Genk side is the underdog from the group. “We are not among the favourite teams to do well in comparison with Liverpool, Napoli as well as Salzburg because they have vast experience in the competition,” Samatta said. He added that obviously, teams likely to do well from their category include reigning champions Liverpool as well as Napoli, while FC Salzburg, despite having few fan base from Tanzania, are not new in the biggest Europe club contest. “Regardless, we should not forget that football has unpredictable results. For a long time, Genk has not played in Champions League as such, we will prepare ourselves well to stage a good resistance against the big teams in the group,” he said. Moreover, Samatta disclosed that he really wanted to be paired in the same group as Barcelona or Real Madrid but said he is happy to play at Anfield Stadium (home of Liverpool FC). “I thank God because he continues to provide awesome blessings on me. I have played in Europa League and now, the Champions League is just around the corner. All these are happening according to his (God) glory,” Samatta uttered. Asked what had happened for his much touted move to English Premier League (EPL), which has failed to materialise, Samatta said he do not even know what went wrong despite having regular contact with his agent concerning the move.
