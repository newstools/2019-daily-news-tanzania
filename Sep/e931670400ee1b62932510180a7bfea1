THE Minister for Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, Dr Harrison Mwakyembe, has commended an initiative aimed at equipping media practitioners with financial and data journalism skills. Dr Mwakyembe made the remarks, in Dar es Salaam yesterday, when opening the six-month Financial Journalism Training (FJT), programme organized and sponsored by Bloomberg Media Initiative Africa (BMIA), to journalists, media stakeholders and trainers from various higher leaning institutions. “The programme has come at the right time when we are working towards achieving middle income economy. Financial skills, data collection and analysis methods are of immense importance at this juncture and therefore, the training to journalists is of immense importance for it will breed, not only professional journalists but also equip them with economic analysing skills,” he said. He added that it was the government’s expectation that the 48 recruited journalists, who are among the 100 that submitted applications from various media houses and academic institutions, will eventually be dedicated to intensively analyse financial and business content. Earlier, while welcoming the Minister, a veteran journalist, Hamza Kasongo, said that even though there have been various scapegoats by various media organisations’ failure to analyses issues, the main challenge was due to lack of skills and training among reporters in the country. “It is rare to come across content, for example, analysing financial benefits and opportunities of the ongoing huge construction projects like the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), or the Nyerere Hydropower project to people living nearby and the general public,” he said. Kasongo also added that the skills will equip journalists on how to avert conflict of interest which affects journalists’ work. “Some stories are killed in media houses for simple reasons like conflicting with advertisers’ interests; Journalists must get financial skills of mitigating this without affecting the right to inform the public,” he said. The fully sponsored programme which kicked off in Dar es Salaam yesterday involves international experts and will end early next year while the second intake will take place in February, next year
