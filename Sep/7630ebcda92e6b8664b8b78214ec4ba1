FINANCIAL institutions in the country over the weekend held the second annual insurance and banking forum in Dar es Salaam with the aim of building capacity to women in financial management issues. The Coordinator for the event who is also the Chairman of African Digital Summit, Baraka Mtavangu said the goal for the forum organized by the African Digital Summit is to empower women working in financial corporates to take top positions of leaderships. “We are also awarding the best women in leadership from the financial institutions,” he said at the forum sponsored by the Banks and Insurance companies. The forum involved women staff from various financial institutions including banks and insurance companies as well as women entrepreneurs countrywide was graced by the Commissioner of Tanzania Insurance Regulatory Authority (TIRA), Dr Mussa Juma. “The forum will help to empower women and promote them to become top leaders in the financial institutions which is the main objective for the forum,” said Dr Juma. According to him, there has been a very patriarchy system of leadership in some of financial institutions for a long time where top positions are for men only. He said sometimes women themselves do not have confidence in their responsibility and think men can be leaders in everything under the world. The participant Mary Mponda who is the Client Relationship Manager, Securities Services in the Department of Treasury and Capital Market, said the forum helps them to boost their confidence and build up the courage for them to take top positions of leaderships in financial corporates. “We women have capacity of doing any activity properly as men but we lack confidence. I hope through forums like this we will get courage to be who we want to be,” she said. On her part the Business Development Manager in the Heritage Insurance Company, Ms Herriet Kileo, said the forum also helps them to discuss ways to tackle various challenges facing women in leadership issues.
