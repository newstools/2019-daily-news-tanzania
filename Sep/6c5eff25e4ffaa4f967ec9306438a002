THE Minister of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children has assured the general public that there is no deadly Ebola outbreak in the country. Speaking to journalists in Dar es Salaam on Saturday morning (September 14, 2019), Minister Ummy Mwalimu said news that went viral on various social media platforms and some of mainstream media, yesterday, on the presence of disease were false. Recently, cases of Ebola death have been reported from neighboring DR Congo and Uganda. “No ebola in Tanzania, no Ebola cases have been reported so far hence public should not panic,” the Minister insisted. After clarifying the matter, the minister said Tanzania has trained over 400 health workers on how to deal with the communicable disease and deployed experts to key boarder posts.
