THE government has assured cashew nut farmers that their payments would be cleared before the start of the new season. The Deputy Minister for Agriculture, Mr Omary Mgumba, allayed farmers’ fears over unpaid cashew nut deliveries, saying their payments would be cleared before the start of the next season. “The government pledge to buy all cashewnut is still on and be assured that before the start of the season all with pending payments will be paid,” said Mr Mgumba. Mr Mgumba was responding to a supplementary question posed by Mr Cecil Mwambe (Ndanda- Chadema) who said there was uncertainty on cashew farmers due to payment delays. The government announced that it would buy all cashew nuts in the current season due to a crisis in which traders failed to meet the indicative prices. “There is an uncertainty on cashew farming and the next season is approaching. When will the government complete payments to farmers?” asked Mr Mwambe without mentioning the number of farmers involved. Mr Mgumba said almost everything was ready and payment would be cleared before the next season starts. “We were waiting for the cashew nut bought in the first phase to be exported and as we speak, it’s done. So, the remaining unpaid farmers will be cleared before the start of the next season,” said Mr Mgumba.
