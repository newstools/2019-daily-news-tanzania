ONE of the conjoined twins who was separated in Saudi Arabia and returned to Tanzania on August 30, Anisia Bernard, died yesterday at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) in Dar es Salaam. MNH Consultant and Paediatric Surgeon, Dr Petrida Ngiloi, told journalists in the city yesterday that after their arrival last Friday they were taken to the facility for normal checkups but Anisia was weaker than her twin sister. “While running tests on them, she began to vomit; which triggered fever and loss of nutrients. We decided to take more tests to establish the reason behind the situation, “ she explained. Dr Ngiloi explained that before the checkup, they had speculated that she was exhausted from the trip or infection but after conducting several tests she was diagnosed with intestinal obstruction. The surgeon said that yesterday morning, they had to conduct a surgery to correct the identified problem, but her condition worsened due to prolonged vomiting. After the surgery she was taken to the Intensive Care Unit, and subsequently, the team discovered that she could not breathe appropriately. “The doctors did whatever they could to save her life but she died; we are all saddened by the news. The other twin, Maryness, is in stable condition,” she further explained. The news of the conjoined twins first surfaced in June 2018, when the country was in grief, mourning the death of conjoined twins Maria and Consolata. It was the time when the country came to know that Maryness and Anisia were born on January 29, 2018, in Kagera Region. The procedure to separate them was carried out at the King Abdullah Specialist Children’s Hospital in Saudi Arabia in December 2018. The operation was carried out in nine phases embracing 32 specialists consisting of doctors, surgeons, technicians and nurses. The twins were conjoined below the chest, abdomen and pelvis. They each had one leg and shared the third leg. They also shared the liver, intestinal tract and urinary and genital tract.
