Chief Agricultural Officer in the Ministry of Agriculture Mr Sadoti Makwaruzi told paddy farmers here that the government has been holding discussion with a chain of business people to develop what it calls a “market network” but insisted the network may only be active with commitment from them. “We have been discussing with business community to provide reliable markets, but we will need farmers to ensure they provide sufficient information as soon as the initiative takes off,” he said.
