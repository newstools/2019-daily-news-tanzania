Water Minister Prof Makame Mbarawa said in a statement issued here over the weekend by the ministry’s Communications Unit that a feasibility study for the water project had been completed. “The government will soon announce a tender for a contractor who will execute the water project in order to embark on the work in January, 2020,” read part of the press statement quoting the minister. Prof Makame Mbarawa is on an official visit to the southern regions of Lindi and Mtwara to inspect water projects there. He said the water project in Kilwa is part of the government’s programme to address water scarcity in 29 towns in the country, saying the programme is being carried out after the government acquired soft loan worth 1.2trillion from India-based Exim Bank. He said another water project worth1.3bn/- which will address water scarcity in Kilwa Kivinje, Kipatimu, Somanga and Pande will soon start, saying the project is a short time plan to address water shortage in the areas. “Let me allay fears of Kilwa residents. We will soon start implementing a water project prior to the mega one as a short term plan to address the problem. We will give priority to the area with severe challenges of water scarcity,” said the minister. On his part, the Member of Parliament for Kilwa Constituency, Mr Salum Bungala, expressed gratitude to the government, noting that residents of Kilwa were delighted by the fifth phase government’s initiatives to address a long time water scarcity in the town.
