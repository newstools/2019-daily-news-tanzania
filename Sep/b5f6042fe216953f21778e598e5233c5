THE Nkasi District Magistrate’s Court, Rukwa Region has sentenced a resident of Ninde village along the shoreline of Lake Tanganyika, Ally Kabwe (20), to serve 50 years in jail after he was found guilty of raping and impregnating a 12 year old pupil. The victim was in standard five at Mkilinga Primary School along the shoreline of Lake Tanganyika at Ninde village in Nkasi District in Rukwa Region. Passing judgment, the trial magistrate, Mr Ramadhan Rugemalila told the court that the prosecution side had proved its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubts that the man had committed the felony. “Actually, the prosecution side had proved its case beyond reasonable doubts against the accused, that the felony you committed is inhuman…. Therefore I sentence you to serve 50 years in prison, I pass this harsh sentence to you as a lesson not only to you but also to others who are itching to commit a similar offence,” ruled the magistrate. Earlier prosecuting, Mr James Mlawa charged before the court that the accused committed the crime at different time and occasions this year at Ninde village along the shoreline of Lake Tanganyika in Nkasi District. On mitigation, the convict prayed for lenient sentence as he was a first offender and has a number of relatives and his parents who are dependent on him entirely.
