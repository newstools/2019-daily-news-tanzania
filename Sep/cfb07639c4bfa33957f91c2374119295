LADIES have been advised to participate at the ongoing Ladies Tennis Coaching Programme (LTCP). Organised by the Dar es Salaam Gymkhana Club (DGC) of Dar es Salaam in collaboration with the LTCP, the coaching programme was officially opened last Monday at the club courts. DGC tennis section captain, Sanjay Chokshi told the ‘Sunday News’ in Dar es Salaam yesterday that programme has already started as planned last month, but they endured poor response from ladies. Chokshi said the programme is eligible for ladies who are aged above 21 and below 50 years. He said that the programme is conducted every Saturday and it is open to both DGC members and non-members. He said that all equipment are provided for participants including rackets for those who don’t have one. However, he said that since the programme started, only few ladies have been showing up for the Saturday’s programme. He appealed for ladies to take the opportunity and enroll for the programme to learn important tennis lessons and also do exercise for their health well-being. The programme runs up to December this year and Chokshi insisted that they will carry on as planned to fulfill the objective of promoting the sport attracting more women in the game. “As we all know, ladies are so busy with their house work, with children and office work, all these prevent them from engaging in sports, it is important also for them to network and create friendship,” he said. He said that they are planning to organise competition at the end of the programme with winner and the runner-up foothome trophies and certificates, while all participants will receive medals.
