FINANCIAL literacy and business support services targeting Small and Medium Entreprises (SMEs) could increase their ability and chances to obtain financing from banks and other available sources. The Tanzania Development Vision 2025 has highlighted SMEs sector as one important contributor to the country’s long-term development. To complement the initiative, KCB Bank Tanzania over the weekend brought together more than 300 business executives to facilitate training on different business techniques and provide much needed exposure to other businesses and suppliers inside and outside the country. It is estimated that Tanzania’s SME sector consists of more than 3 million enterprises which contribute to 27 per cent of overall GDP. Most of them are in the agricultural sector, and more than half are owned by women. The KCB Bank Head of Marketing and Corporate Affairs, Ms Christine Manyenye said the bank made deliberate efforts through the 2nd Biashara club workshop for 2019 to bring in stakeholders such as Jane Kadoda from the National Environment Management Council (NEMC) who spoke on the impact of businesses on the environment as well the importance of adherence to environmental guidelines put in place by the Tanzanian government. “KCB Bank understands the importance of the SME sector in growing the country’s economy but also realises that this cannot be achieved if the SMEs do not have the right skills in developing and managing their businesses,” she said In March 2019, KCB Bank held similar event in Arusha with a special focus on the tourism industry. On the other hand, Mr Fasili Boniface a representative from European Investment Bank (EIB) touched on keeping financial records, compartmentalisation of business expenses against personal expenses. KCB Bank through Biashara Club also arranges business trips to countries like China, Malaysia and South Africa at reduced costs for its Biashara Club members with the aim of assisting them to gain new markets as well as access to different products for import to the Tanzanian market
