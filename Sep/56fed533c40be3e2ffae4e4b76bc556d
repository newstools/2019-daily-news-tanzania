FINANCE and Planning Minister, Dr Philip Mpango has directed banks and financial institutions that offer loans to public servants at alarming interest rates to review their calculations formula. He directed the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) to closely make a follow up on the bank’s interest so that public servants and other wananchi could access loans at affordable rates. Dr Mpango gave the directive over the weekend during Hazina Saving and Credit Cooperative Society Ltd (SACCOS) meeting in which members, including the minister were handed over with land titles for Ihumwa- Ngaloni area. “I have come across financial institutions that issue loans at 32-per cent interest rate, which is too much for a public servant to afford. I would like to know how they arrived to that calculation” he warned. The Minister also ordered BoT to meet with banks and other financial institutions that issue loans with unrealistic interest rates of around 20 percent. “Banks and other financial institutions must be realistic in their calculations, BoT must make a close monitoring to ensure all procedures are followed in offering loans to wananchi,” he noted. He wanted SACCOS to set up strong financial management system that will avert any form of embezzlement and make sure serious legal measures are taken to whoever dares to tamper with the system. Hazina Saccos Chairman, Mr Aliko Mwaiteleke pledged to come up with more projects as he called for government to link them with financial institutions that will help to boost their capital. At least 230 members of Hazina Saccos received land title deeds on Saturday.
