MINISTER of State in the President’s Office (Regional Administration and Local Government) Selemani Jafo has praised a University of Dodoma (Udom), lecturer for setting up a scholarship award for advanced level (high school), education. Dr Ombeni Msuya, has started Dr Ombeni Msuya Scholarship Award for students, who cannot afford to cover school fees and other high school costs. Mr Jafo noted recently that the Scholarship Award complimented the fifth phase government efforts to ensure all schoolchildren got access to secondary education for their bright future. “May I congratulate Dr Msuya on establishing the Scholarship Award to support students from poor families to pursue high school studies,” said the minister during an occasion to receive a cheque worth 3.5m/- for 23 students who had received scholarship for the 2019/20 academic year. Mr Jafo urged Dr Msuya to continue supporting more students to pursue advanced level education. For his part, Dr Msuya said the Scholarship Award started last year to support students, who could not afford school fees and school uniforms, saying the programme targeted especially orphans and girl students, who had excelled in Form Five exam results. “We came up with the idea of supporting the students from poor families as a way of giving back to members of the public what the government had done to us in education for over 30 years,” said the Udom lecturer. Dr Msuya noted that so far, at least 37 high school students were benefiting from the Scholarship Award since last year, saying they were undertaking studies in different high school combinations in 23 regions. “Presently, 20 girl students and 17 boy students are benefiting from the Scholarship Award since last year,” he explained.
