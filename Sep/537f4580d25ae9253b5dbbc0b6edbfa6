SIMBA SC hitman Meddie Kagere was instrumental in Rwanda’s voluminous 3-0 win over Seychelles in the Victoria in their World Cup first round, first leg qualifier in Victoria yesterday. He scored the third goal to earn his team a huge lead against hosts Seychelles. Two goals in the space of four minutes helped Rwanda to a comfortable 3-0 away win over the Seychelles Muhadjiri Hakizimana opened the scoring just after the half hour mark and Yannick Mukunzi added a second in the 36th minute to put the Amavubi within touching distance of the group phase of the African qualifiers for Qatar 2022. Meddy Kagare made sure of the biggest winning margin of the African qualifiers so far with the third goal 10 minutes from time. Rwanda host the return leg of the tie in Kigali on Tuesday and on the evidence of Thursday’s game should have little problem disposing of the Indian Ocean islanders. Seychelles had been poorly prepared coming into the game, with coach Jan Mak only arriving in the country on Sunday. The 74-year-old from the Netherlands has been parachuted in to handle the Seychelles team on a two month contract after previous coach Gavin Rennie did not have his deal extended. Hakizimana hit the woodwork not long before the opening goal, which was a well placed shot just inside the post from outside the penalty area as the Seychelles failed to clear a corner. Rwanda kept up the pressure, with home goalkeeper Romeo Barra making a series of saves, before the second came six minutes later, also from a corner with Mukunzi unmarked at the back post and able to finish easily. Kagere squeezed the ball home from a tight angle for the third.
