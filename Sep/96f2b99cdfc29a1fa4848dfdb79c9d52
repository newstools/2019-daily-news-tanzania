TANZANIA Gender Networking Programme (TGNP) has brought together various stakeholders to discuss obstacles hampering women from vying for political posts in Mara Region. The stakeholders met in Tarime District, Mara Region, during a three-day workshop which ended over the weekend. “The aim of the workshop is to increase participation of Tarime women in politics and leadership”, Dr Consolata Sulley, a lecturer from the department of political science and public administration at the University of Dar es salaam said here over the weekend. “We have told them to shelve the old misconception that women’s job is to stay in the kitchen, “ Dr Sulley pointed out. The workshop took place at the time when Tanzania is preparing to hold civic elections later this year to be followed by the General Election next year. About 35 participants attended the TGNP workshop. They included traditional and religious leaders, representatives from non-governmental organizations based in Tarime, councillors and village chairpersons. Dr Sulley enlightened them on the fundamental rights of women according to the constitution and international and regional treaties which Tanzania has ratified. She said some of the treaties, including the Beijing Declaration, were developed to deliberately uplift the status of women across the globe. “We believe that the participants will spread the education they got when they return to their areas. For example the voices of traditional and religious leaders can be very helpful in ending traditions which are obstacles, “ she said. The participants cited traditional beliefs as the major challenge facing Tarime women from becoming active in politics. The traditional elders welcomed the workshop promising to support the initiative by sensitizing Tarime women to contest for political posts at all levels.
