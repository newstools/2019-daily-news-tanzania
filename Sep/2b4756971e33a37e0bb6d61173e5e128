UGANDA and Tanzania business forum starting today is expected to further expand trade between the two East African states. Data from the United Nations COMTRADE database shows that Tanzania exports over three times the amount it imports from Uganda. The data shows that Tanzania exports to Uganda was 194.42 million US dollars last year compared to Kampala exports to Dar es Salaam at 66.28 million US dollars during the similar period. Stanbic Tanzania Head of Corporate and Investment Banking, Mr Manzi Rwegasira, said that over the years, the trade value between Uganda and Tanzania has been positively increasing. “It is through summits such as these that we can accelerate growth in trade by unlocking barriers to trade,” Mr Rwegasira said through a release yesterday. The two-day Business Summit kicks off today at the Julius Nyerere International Conference Centre in Dar es Salaam expecting to attract over 500 delegates not only within the East African Community but also from other global organisations. The forum, the first of its kind, aims at boosting the long-standing bilateral trade and investment flows between Uganda and Tanzania. “Trade between the two countries’ private sector plays a crucial role in strengthening their existing cooperation as well as enabling economic progress within the region…. Trade will also enhance crossborder investments,” Mr Rwegasira said. It will feature a business exhibition aimed at facilitating extensive business to business (B2B), engagement opportunities to unlock new private sector partnerships between the two countries. The summit will also feature enlightening presentations and numerous informative plenary sessions that will help businesses understand positive policy changes that aim at improving trade. The event will also be graced by the Heads of State of the respective two countries, underlining its importance in boosting economic activity not only within the EAC, but also beyond The Great Lakes Region.
