PREVENTION and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) has called upon the public to collaborate in the fight against sexual corruption and urged men also going through such vice not to fear, but report them. That was said at a workshop on ‘Safe Journey to Female School Children without Sexual Corruption is Possible’ in Dar es Salaam recently organized by WAJIKI nongovernmental organization by PCCB Kinondoni Regional Office Head of Public Education Desk, Ms Elli Makala, adding that even men who also report such incidences against them do not follow their cases to the end because of being shy. “The Bureau fights any kind of bribe and to a large extent succeeds, but very rare on sexual corruption and this is because investigations normally face obstacles when those complaining hesitate and refuse to continue offering cooperation,” she said. Ms Makala said that unlike many people’s perceptions, proving sexual corruption only becomes possible when there is cooperation of the complainant in the case. “We all know where sexual corruption ends. Thus, while the two are on their journey to bed, the complainant should have tipped or alerted PCCB to let investigators be on the scene before the final mission,” she said. However, Ms Makala admitted that the number of females becoming susceptible to sexual extortion was in comparison bigger to that of men, but still urged men to cooperate and report their cases. On her part, WAJIKI Executive Director, Ms Janeth Mawinza said that every person has a right to fight sexual bribe and urged the society to unite against the vice. Commenting, a bus conductor plying between Tegeta and Makumbusho, Ms Warda Nassoro said sexual extortion still exist in the society and also face them. The event was sponsored by Women Fund Tanzania (WFT), where it spent about 50m/- on public awareness campaigns.
