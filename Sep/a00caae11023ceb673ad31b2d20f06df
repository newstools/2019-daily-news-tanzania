WITH government implementation of a number of development projects, the Economic and Social Research Foundation (ESRF) has launched a two-year training programme to build capacity on conducting impact evaluation research. The targeted individuals to benefit from the training include researchers, policy analysts, economists, project managers and monitoring and evaluation staff. Finance and Planning Deputy Permanent Secretary Mary Maganga officiated the launching of the programme in Dar es Salaam, yesterday. The programme, dubbed ‘Impact evaluation laboratory’, is expected to create a community of practice in impact evaluation in the country and network it with relevant institutions working in the same field of impact evaluation around the world. “In my view, this capacity development initiative is very relevant to development processes taking place in our country,” she said. Tanzania currently implements National Second Five Year’s Development Plan 2016/17-2020/21 with the theme ‘Nurturing industrialization for economic transformation and human development’. The fifth phase government focuses on implementing development interventions which demonstrate clear results and impact to peoples’ welfare. She argued that the necessity of such training was based on the fact that planning and implementation of any effective development intervention must be associated with regular feedback mechanism in the form of monitoring and evaluation. ESRF Executive Director Dr Tausi Kida noted in her speech that for the past four years they had been engaging in building capacity on impact evaluation. In 2015, the foundation advertised and conducted one week training courses on the matter which was attended by 17 students. Last year, ESRF secured a grant from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to support the training courses.
