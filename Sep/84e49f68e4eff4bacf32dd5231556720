Mr Wangabo made the revelation while explaining food security projections in the region, adding that statistics show that the region has realised 884,368.68 tonnes of food. “The actual food demand for a population of 1,292,422 people is 413,575 tonnes, which means the re- gion will have a surplus of 470,793 tonnes of food of which 215,574.35 tonnes will be of maize,” the RC explained. Speaking on the 2019/20 maize purchasing season through the National Food Reserve Agency (NFRA), Sumbawanga Zone, the RC confirmed that the food agency eyes to purchase 18,000 tonnes of maize, of which 13,000 tonnes from Rukwa and 5,000 tonnes from Katavi Region. Equally, Mr Wangabo directed NFRA Sumbawanga Zone to give first priority to small scale farmers who are facing challenges in scouting for competitive and reliable markets for their produces, while big traders have finan- cial muscles to get the markets. The NFRA Sumbawanga Zone Manager, Mr Abdillahi Nyangasa, called upon farmers in both Rukwa and Katavi region to ensure that their produces especially maize are of best quality, insisting that government will never accept maize which does not meet best standards.
