MEMBERS of Parliament (MPs) yesterday ratified the 2013 Minamata Convention on Mercury that aims at protecting human health and environment from the substance dangers The convention ratification means that Tanzania has joined the world in the war against mercury uses. Minamata Convention on Mercury is a multilateral environmental agreement that addresses specific human activities, which contribute to widespread mercury pollution. Implementation of the pact is expected to reduce global mercury pollution over the coming decades. Tabling the Convention, Minister of State in the Vice-President’s Office—Union Affairs and Environment—George Simbachawene said with ratification, the government will ably save people especially miners from the adverse effects of mercury. He said almost 23 per cent of artisanal and small scale miners have been affected by mercury, with many others suffering from kidney, liver, neurological and other health complications due to indiscriminate mercury uses. Mr Simbachawene said with convention ratification, all factories and companies will have to stop using mercury in the country, arguing that mercury is the substance that produces significant adverse effects with particular concerns expressed on its harmful effects on unborn children and infants.
