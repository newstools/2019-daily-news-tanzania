The bank’s Chief Manager- Commercial, Mr James Ngaluko said that, the target was to collect 15bn/-but it has managed to collect an extra of 3.5bn/- which makes the campaign successful by 123 percent. “ The campaign focused on fixed account operations, where we provided interest of 14 percent to our customers. The bank received a good number of customers as a result of timely interest payment,” he said. The campaign officially ended yesterday but customers will continue to benefit with ‘Lamba Kwanza’ as a new Bank’s product. He said customers are encouraged to make deposits from three to 24 months. He affirmed that the available amount (18.5 bn/-) will be channeled to various areas, including loans to small scale entrepreneurs, as part of supporting the government’s strategies to improve the financial sector. The Bank has been also considering the decrease in loans interests for the same purposes. “ The same is applied to other types of the services we offer like mortgage. There is a decrease in interest (from 22.8 percent to less than 20 percent), and extension of time for debts clearance, from 10 to 15 years,” he said. It was further noted that, DCB made a remarkable achievement through shares where it managed to sell shares worth 36.6 m/-. Earlier, the bank targeted to sell shares worth 33.9m/-
