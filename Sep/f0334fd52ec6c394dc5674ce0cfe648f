THE government has warned employers in the private sector who are still reluctant to comply with minimum wages that they risk punishment. Zanzibar's civil servant monthly minimum wage is 300,000/-since 2017, and in the private sector it is 180,000/-, but some employees, particularly domestic workers (house girls/boys), drivers, day workers, and staff in some hotels are complaining that they are not paid the amount they deserve. Legislator, Jaku Hashim Ayoub (Paje), asked the government to take disciplinary measures against employers who have not complied, because it is a violation of the law, causing inconvenience to domestic workers who also complain about being denied food and rest. Deputy Minister for Labour, Empowerment, Elderly, Children and Women, Ms Shadya Mohamed Suleiman said, "All employers in the private sector are obliged to implement the law, which includes paying the minimum wage, signing contracts with employees and ensuring safety at workplaces."
