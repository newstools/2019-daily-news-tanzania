SIDO Arusha Regional Manager, Nina Nchimbi revealed yesterday that the loans that were disbursed from 2014 to 2019 benefitted 528 men and 352 women. The Manager added that between 2018 and 2019 some 116 industries were established and 14 of them have been approved and granted quality standard mark. Each of these industries has created at least 50 jobs. She said that after receiving the loans, entrepreneurs managed to establish new businesses, small-scale industries, mining activities and livestock keeping. “Before issuing the loans, we trained and imparted entrepreneurship skills to beneficiaries to equip them so that they can produce high quality goods that compete on the market,” she said. She added that SIDO is supporting entrepreneurs and other people through technological development so that they can take an active role in building an industrial economy. “For example, SIDO helps entrepreneurs to access high tech machines from within and outside the country in order to produce goods that can meet market demands. “We have seven branches countrywide that can offer technical advice to entrepreneurs on how to access high tech machines namely Shinyanga, Mbeya, Arusha, Iringa, Kigoma, Dar es Salaam and Lindi,” she said. Furthermore, she said SIDO has programmes aimed at empowering and equipping graduates who have tech ideas in order to make them grow and become productive in the economy. She added that in 2019, SIDO trained 652 entrepreneurs on 28 courses of processing various goods namely soap, oil, development of business ideas and others. The industrial economy aligns with selling high quality products that can easily penetrate domestic and regional markets
