ARUSHA Football Club (AFC), is stuck in Mwanza without a single cent and no means of transport to bring them back home for their next First Division League (FDL), tie. According to the FDL fixture, AFC have a date against Transcamp FC at the Sheikh Amri Abeid Kaluta Stadium tomorrow. AFC had travelled to Mwanza last week and played against Gwambina FC in Misungwi, where they lost 3-0, then later on faced Pamba FC at Nyamagana Stadium of Mwanza and suffered a 2-1 defeat. After the match, the team returned to Misungwi, where they are now stuck at the hotel. The 24 team members have also been checked out of their rooms, for failing to settle their bills and are reportedly hungry with nothing to eat. Speaking by phone from Mwanza, the AFC Team Manager, Omar Muhomba raised flag of mercy to residents of Arusha to help rescue the team, so that they may be able to travel back home. The army team of Transcamp from Dar es Salaam has just arrived in Arusha, ready for their match against AFC tomorrow but the hosts are nowhere to be seen, being held ransom in the Lake Zone with astounding bills yet to be settled. AFC Coach, Ulimboka Mwakingwe admitted that the team is in dire straits and need help, especially because if they miss their tomorrowâ€™s match against Transcamp they will be demoted to Second Division League.
