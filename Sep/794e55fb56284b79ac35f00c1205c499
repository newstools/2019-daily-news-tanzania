THE government has allocated about 7.8bn/- for compensation to residents of Mombose and and Bubutole villages who will be required to relocate to pave the way for the construction of Farkwa dam in Chemba District. The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Water, Professor Kitila Mkumbo, said here that the compensation would be paid to all residents before the end of next month and that the dam was expected to cover an area surrounding the two villages. He was speaking at a meeting of Village Executive Officers (WEOs) and officials from Chemba District Council, at which he explained that 2,898 villagers are expected to relocate to pave the way for the project. “The government has already allocated money for the project and my ministry has received the money from the treasury; what remains now are preparations by a team of engineers in the ministry to prepare the schedule for setting the project in motion. “As leaders, you should prepare the residents psychologically by disclosing the truth to them, which is that they must vacate immediately after being paid, so that construction begins,’’ he said. After its completion, Prof Mkumbo added, the dam would supply water in Dodoma city as well as Chamwino, Chemba and Bahi districts. In addition, he noted, the feasibility study of which was conducted in 2015, the dam would facilitate the initiation and sustenance of many socioeconomic activities. According to Dodoma Urban Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DUWASA) Chief Executive Officer, Engineer David Pallangyo, the meeting aimed at bringing together leaders in the district so that they can come up with a common stand before the project kicks off.
