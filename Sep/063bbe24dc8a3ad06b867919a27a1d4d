THE Rukwa Regional Commissioner (RC), Joachim Wangabo said he was irked by reports that over 1.2bn, being domestic revenue collection is still in the hands of revenue collectors as the fund is not seen on Local Government Revenue Collection Information System â€“LGRCIS. Expounding further, the RC further explained that revenue collectors who are Ward Executive Officers (WEO), from all four council have not remitted 1,217,350,090.85 being domestic revenues they had collected so that the collection could be seen on LGRCIS and then banked it. "It is very shocking and disheartening to hear that domestic revenue collection amounting to over 1.2 bn/-is still in the hands of revenue collectors from all four councils of Sumbawanga, Nkasi and, Kalambo districts as well as Sumbawanga municipality, of which the collections were to be remitted on September 23, this year. The RC noted that Sumbawanga District Council alone, revenue collectors have not remitted to LGRCIS 695,288,837.45. Following such irregularity, the RC ordered and gave six days to all revenue collectors to remit the collected domestic revenues to LGRCIS so that councils could bank them. Mr Wangabo said this during a special meeting where domestic revenue collection reports were presented by the Head of Section of Regional Administrate and Local Government (Tamisemi), from Rukwa Region Secretariat, Mr Albinus Mugonya. The meeting attracted council directors, internal auditors and TEHAMA officials. Equally the RC directed the Rukwa Regional Administrative Director (RAS), Mr Bernard Makali to ensure that internal auditors are protected, telling them not to be scared by anyone whose objective is to gain cheap political popularity. Mr Wangabo added that auditing statements issued by internal auditors should be quickly worked on by councils in efforts of getting rid of.
