THE Minister for Home Affairs Kangi Lugola has warned Immigration Officers, who scare investors by declaring them Prohibited Immigrants (PI) of stern measures. He said that the trend must be stopped and unacceptable adding that whoever would be identified to have stamped one as falling in the class would face measures, because that in a way is damaging the country’s image. The minister made the speech here while opening a two-day meeting, where Senior Immigration Officers from Mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar attended. Mr Lugola said that one of responsibilities of the Immigration Department was to ensure that foreigners, especially investors are not harassed. He noted that there have been some complaints that when some foreigners come to invest in the country, some of them (Immigration Officers) connive with some nationals to scare and kick them outside the country. “Some of the Immigration Officers lie that some Officials from the Tanzania Intelligence and Security Services (TISS) are the ones who slap the foreigners with PI notice, but this is unfortunate and damages our country’s image and it must stop immediately,” said Mr Lugola. He said that President John Magufuli was taking time and using a lot of energy to woo investors and ensure that they do business in the country, but some public servants are not supporting the move. On her part, Kilimanjaro Region Commissioner (RC), Ms Anna Mghwira said that because of the vastness of the area and borders, some areas are still not manned by the Immigration Department. Commenting, the Commissioner General for Immigration Department, Dr Anna Makakala said the meeting was aimed at analyzing their performance and reminded the Senior Officials not to take the law into their hands, but struggle to improve services to the citizens and foreigners.
