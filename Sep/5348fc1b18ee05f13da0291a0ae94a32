HIGH demand greeted the auctioning of a 15- year bond by the Bank of Tanzania (BoT), last week, ending the trading session oversubscribed. Through the debt instrument, the government wanted to raise 109bn/- but the amount tendered jumped to 116.62bn/-. Nevertheless, apart from the oversubscription, the government retained only 94.73bn/-as successful amount. This is the fifth 15- year debt instrument to be auctioned this year of which three ended the session oversubscribed and two undersubscribed. The institutional investors namely commercial banks, pension funds, insurance companies and some microfinance institutions are among the active participants in the debt instrument. The introduction of the 15-year instrument and other long term facilities has widened investorsâ€™ options and investment opportunities in the debt markets alongside other government securities like the two, five, seven, 10 and 20 years bonds. The 15.14 per cent coupon rate offered in the 15-year instrument held on Wednesday last week was slightly down compared to 15.42 per cent of the session held in July. The weighted average yield to maturity declined slightly to 15.36 percent compared to 15.67 per cent of the previous session that took place in July. The number of bids received during the session were 66 and 40 emerged to be successful bids. The government raises funds through the 15 years Treasury bonds to fund long term projects some of which are expected to start generating income before the instrument matures. Some of the long term infrastructural projects that benefit from the funds may include industries, roads, railway, bridges, ports and airports expansion. The implementation of the projects would stimulate business growth, contribute to improved living standards and subsequently the government collects more revenue.
