WATER Minister Prof Makame Mbarawa has given a three month ultimatum to water supply and sanitation authorities that are charging water clients at flats rates to install meters. According to a press statement issued by the ministry, he issued the ultimatum during a recent event to launch Shilima water project in Kwimba District in Mwanza Region. “Water meters will enable clients to be charged in accordance to their consumption. Water supply and sanitation authorities should also control water leakage and extend supply networks to uplift the level of revenues,” read part of the statement. Giving a briefing on the project, Kwimba District Manager for Rural and Urban Water Supply Authority (RUWASA), Engineer, Boaz Matundalo, said the Shilima water project, which started in 2013, was supposed to be completed within six months. However, he said the project had taken over five years to be completed due to poor management by the assigned contractor, saying project would address a long time scarcity in the area. While launching Ng’ong’ona water project in Dodoma recently, Prof Mbarawa said the government was committed to renovate all 88 defunct water projects across the country to ensure that most people got access to water services by the year 2020. Shilima water project is one of the defunct water projects taken over by the government to ensure that members of the public in the area get access to the precious liquid. Prof Mbarawa noted that the government was using engineers from water supply and sanitation authorities to renovate defunct water projects which were executed by private contractors. “We are renovating all defunct water projects which had been carried out by private contractors since 2010,” said the minister while addressing residents of Ng’ong’ona Ward.
