They wound up their group assignments with another big win, with a 5-0 scoreline against Ethiopia. Heroes progressed to the quarter-finals as Group B winners thanks to the fair play rule where they had fewer cards accumulated than Kenya.

Eritrea finished as the best team in Group A followed by Sudan as Uganda Hippos took third place. The semi-finals are scheduled to be played on October 2.
