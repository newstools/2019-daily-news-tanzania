EDUCATION, Technology and Vocational Training Minister, Prof Joyce Ndalichako has urged teachers to cultivate saving culture as way to achieve future development goals. Prof Ndalichako told representative of teachers from all districts in Kigoma Region at the forum organised by Mwalimu Commercial Bank that saving can help become financially secure and provide a safety net in case of an emergency. Through the forum, Mwalimu Commercial Bank provided knowledge on financial literacy and the need for teachers to cultivate saving culture that will help addressing financial problems. “Teachers should not face financial problems for lacking the necessary knowledge and skills on financial matters,” she said urging Mwalimu Commercial bank to continue providing financial literacy to teachers for the improvement of their living standards. Prof Ndalichako urged teachers to support Mwalimu Commercial bank, which is their bank by opening accounts, depositing as well as making use of the various banking services. The bank’s Chief Executive Officer Richard Makungwa said the bank is committed to reach more customers particularly teachers so that they can benefit on various banking services. “Taking into consideration the number of teachers in the country, the bank is set to be one of the giant financial institutions if they decide banking with it,” he added.
