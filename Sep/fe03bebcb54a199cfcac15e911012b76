AT least 85,000 vulnerable residents in Dar es Salaam have benefited from Dar-Urban project worth 9m/-(about USD 4.3 million), implemented in the city during the last 15 years. The project which ended recently was implemented by the World Vision Tanzania. The project targeted to economically empower poor families, expecting to rescue children from risky behaviors, and thus building a better society. Acting Executive Director of the World Vision Tanzania, Ms Joan Kiiza, stated that during the past 15 years, the project successfully empowered a number of families to have income-generating activities, keeping children in schools and creating awareness among the communities over rights of the children. Ms Kiiza explained that they managed to reach a total of 15,426 vulnerable children who benefited from awareness education on their rights, keeping them in school and protecting them from risky environments. “As we are today marking the deadline for implementation of the project, we are handing over the project to the government for sustainability,” she said at the closing ceremony in Dar es Salaam. The project, funded by the World Vision Australia, mainly benefited residents at Mwabepande and Bunju ward in the city, where during the start of the project, it was found that majority of the children were at risk due to family poverty. Kinondoni District Administrative Secretary (DAS), Ms Stellah Msoffe, said the Dar-Urban project showed great successes during its implementation in improving availability of clean and safe water.
