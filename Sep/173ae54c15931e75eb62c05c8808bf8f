THE third edition of the Loliondo- Serengeti Marathon has been moved to November from its previous date of December, the organisers unveiled here yesterday. Already a special preparatory committee for the race has been put together by the Ngorongoro District Commissioner Rashid Taka to ensure that this year’s event, despite being scheduled on earlier, surpasses the previous events in terms of successes. One of the committee members, who also serve as the race coordinator, Paul Dudui said they have decided to change the marathon time from the previous December dates and choosing to stage this year’s event in November because the final month of the year is usually a busy one as people travel for their holidays. Loliondo-Serengeti marathon is aimed at promoting the ecology of the Serengeti plains and surrounding precincts in terms of tourism, wildlife conservation and the preservation of natural vegetation within the legendary eco-system. The Serengeti Eco-system, which the race focuses on, consists of Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Loliondo Game Controlled Area, Lake Natron and Maswa Game Reserves, Oldonyo Lengai Volcano and Kenya’s Maasai Mara. Speaking of the race achievements since its inception in 2017, the organisers explained that, participants from various countries have helped to promote the local tourists attractions while the marathon itself is also a form of tourism through running. According to Dudui, the Loliondo-Serengeti Marathon is essentially a 21km racing event; “We had intended to stretch the distance into a full 42.2 kilometres’ Marathon but we are still facing some technical complications that once ironed, we may attain it next year 2020,” he said.
