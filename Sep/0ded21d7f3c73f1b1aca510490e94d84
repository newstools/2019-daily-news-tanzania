He asked the minister to order officials to visit live-stock keepers and give them guidance. Another pastoralist, Mr Zuberi Munga, who practices modern animal husbandry, told the minister that he faces a shortage of cattle feeds, asking for a solution.

He said that the government was also intending to eradicate cattle diseases because there were enough vaccinations and drugs for the purpose. He called upon Kiteto councillors to support the government in ensuring that laws and regulations were adhered to.
