PRESIDENT John Magufuli has offered 10m/- to the national football team heading for African Cup of Nations for Amputee Football in Benguela, Angola early next month. The continental level championship will open its kick off on October 1st in Benguela, Angola’s second largest city. The money was handed over to the team’s officials by President’s secretary Ngusa Samike yesterday at the offices of Tanzania Broadcasting Corporation (TBC) in Dar es Salaam to facilitate the team’s trip to Angola. As greetings from President Magufuli, Ngusa commended the team for winning a ticket to represent the country in the prestigious tournament and wished them good luck. The President also urged the Tanzanians to support the team and other country’s envoys in various tournaments. “To play or participate in sports is also remedy to the people with physical disabilities. I congratulate you all for winning a ticket to play CANAF 2019 Finals and I believe the society will keep supporting you,” he said. The president of Tanzania Amputee Football Federation (TAFFA) Hamad Komboza thanked the president for the support and his kind heart to people with disabilities.
