THE Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Minerals, Prof Simon Msanjila, has urged great lakes region countries to closely work together in fighting smuggling of minerals. Speaking during the official opening of the 14th Meeting of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) Audit Committee, Prof Msanjila said gold smuggling is still a huge problem because it hinders economic growth of the affected countries. Prof Msanjila said the Ministry of Minerals is particularly overseeing the implementation of Article 9 of the ICGLR pact, which looks at the protocol on the fight against illegal exploitation of natural resources. He added that under the protocol, member states are required to put in place a regional certification mechanism for the exploration, monitoring and verification of natural resources within the great lakes which mainly focuses on designated minerals: tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (3T and G). Prof Msanjila said Tanzania has already prepared an inspection manual and national road map on the implementation of Regional Certification Mechanism (RCM). He added that the Ministry will ensure that mining activities in Tanzania are regulated in accordance with national, regional and international frameworks. The ICGLR Executive Director, Zachary Muburi-Muita, said their meeting envisages fulfilling objectives of accreditation of new editors, capacity building sessions for members of the audit committee and the election of a new Committee Bureau. Mr Muburi-Muita congratulated the Burundian government for the progress made on mine site inspections and third party audits at all active exporting companies. The ICGLR Audit Committee Chairman, Mr Bwesigye Don Binyanga congratulated the tremendous steps taken by the Tanzanian government towards the regional certification mechanism.
