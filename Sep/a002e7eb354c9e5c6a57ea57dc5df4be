He said that China has become the world’s second largest economy, the largest industrialised country with the largest trade in goods and that new technologies like 5G, big data, cloud computing and artificial intelligence were driving the Chinese economy forward faster. Mr Xiaowu mentioned many achievements in the past 70 years in all sectors, saying the friendly relationship between China and Tanzania was established and nurtured under the leadership of founder leaders— Mao Zedong, Mwalimu Julius Nyerere and Sheikh Abeid Karume. “Let us strengthen our mutual relation,” he emphasized, adding that the recent (September 17, 2019) move by Chinese President Xi Jinping to issue a presidential decree for ‘Friendship Medal,’ the highest rare honour, to former Prime Minister Salim Ahmed Salim, further cements the friendship. Minister of State in the President’s Office, Public Service and Good Governance Haroun Ali Suleiman was the Chief Guest at the celebration and his message was, “We love China because it has been doing a lot in supporting our development programmes.” He said China has supported education projects including capacity building and scholarships for further studies, infrastructure improvement, media, sports (mainly construction of playgrounds) and tourism, among others.
