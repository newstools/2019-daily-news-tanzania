THE week that ended on the 20th September 2019 was an eventful week for the market as it produced the highest weekly turnover in the history of the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange thanks to a transaction between Vodacom Group Ltd of South Africa and Mirambo Ltd of Tanzania. The 499.8bn/- (220 million US dollars) transaction boosted the Tanzania Share Index (TSI), the first such movement in four weeks, by 40.5 points to close the week at 3,332.33 points. Domestic market capitalization grew by 1.23 per cent to 9.17tri/- (3.99 billion US dollars) compared to 9.0tri/- (3.94 billion US dollars) posted during the previous week. Total equity turnover during the week stood at 504.96 billion (219.47 million US dollars) of which more than 98 per cent was moved on the Vodacom counter in one transaction. Vodacom Group bought 588,000,070 Vodacom (T) shares from Mirambo Ltd to increase their stake in Vodacom (T) to 75 per cent while the public holds the rest 25 per cent. The merger and acquisition (M&A) transaction had been in the works for well over a year. From the transaction, the economy will have benefitted through taxes, market and regulatory fees and charges and advisory fees which go straight to the GDP as additions. Vodacom Group’s increasing stake in Vodacom Tanzania is a vote of confidence to the telecom company and the Tanzania capital markets in general. At the middle of the M&A transaction was of course Tanzania’s leading brokerage firm in, Orbit Securities Co. Ltd (ORBIT). ORBIT was also the Lead Transaction Advisor and Sponsoring Broker for the Vodacom Plc IPO back in 2017 and was selected for repeat roles in the latest transaction, advising and assisting the two companies during the whole process over the past two years of negotiations and seeking regulatory approvals. The transaction sets yet another milestone for the market and for ORBIT as the largest transaction to ever go through the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange in a single trading session. To put matters into perspective, the turnover realized in the transaction is more than twice the total turnover throughout 2018 for the whole market. The transaction also improved the market price for Vodacom Tanzania from 800/- to 850/- per share. Consequently, total market capitalization grew by 1.11 per cent to 19tri/- (8.27 billion US dollars) while adding 21.11 points to the All Share Index (DSEI) which closed the week at 1,930.47 points. In addition to the 6.25 per cent appreciation of Vodacom Tanzania shares following the transaction, total market capitalisation was also boosted price changes at Acacia Plc and EABL counters which recorded appreciations by 1.52 per cent and 0.92 per cent respectively. It is noteworthy, though, that Acacia was delisted from the London Stock Exchange effectively on the 18th September 2019 and will soon be delisted from DSE. Appreciation of the above heavyweights was high enough to neutralize price depreciation at the DSE Plc counter by 1.85 per cent to close at 1,060/- following declining activities in the market. Equity turnover, a significant indicator of DSE Plc’s earning capacity, totalled to 85bn/- (36.9 million US dollars) for the first eight months of 2019 compared to 158.84bn/- (69 million US dollars) for a similar period in 2018 [2017: TZS 246.37 billion ($107 million)] thus a turnover ratio (turnover to capitalization) of 0.94 per cent, 1.46 per cent and 2.46 per cent for the periods respectively, despite 2019 having the lowest domestic capitalization among the three periods. Money Market, Bills and Bonds A total of 70.2bn/- (30.5 million US dollars) were traded in the Interbank Money Market (IMM) during the week, recording a slowdown of 42 per cent week on week. The previous week saw a total of 121.5bn/- (52.81 million US dollars) being traded through the market. Interbank rates have been fluctuating in the upside during the week, closing the week at 5.5 per cent, an uptick of 51bps compared to 5.04 per cent in the end of the previous week. The public maintained interest in the 364days Treasury Bills security as the Treasury auction held by the Bank of Tanzania on the 18th September 2019 gets oversubscribed by more than two folds of the offered amount. The Bank of Tanzania offered Treasury Bills worth 107bn/- (46.5 million US dollars) while the market tendered a total of 260bn/- (113.2 million US dollars) and as usual most of the funds fetched the 364 days tenor. The Bank accepted a total of 110.3bn/- (47.94 million US dollars) which is 3 per cent above the offer size and 42 per cent of the tender size respectively. The weighted average yield to maturity (WAYTM) maintained a downward trend eight Treasury Bills auctions in a row, shredding 39bps during the auction under review, reporting a WAYTM of 6.85 per cent compared to 7.24 per cent during the previous Treasury Bills auction. Currency Market The Interbank Foreign Exchange Market (IFEM) decelerated during the third week of September, reporting the slowest week of the month which saw total transactions slow down by 61 per cent week on week to record a total of 21.42 million US dollars compared to 54.48 million US dollars during the previous week. The shilling depreciated for the third consecutive week, losing 14 pips during the week, to report a weighted average exchange rate of TZS 2,300.88/USD from previous week’s TZS 2,300.74/USD.
