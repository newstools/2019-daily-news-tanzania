TANZANIA Civil Society Consortium on Election Observation (TACCEO) and Policy Forum has commended the government as 70 per cent of their recommendations have been accommodated in the regulations of the forthcoming local government elections. Submitting a statement on regulations for local government elections slated for November 24, this year, TACCEO Chairperson Ms Martina Kabisama commended the government for having the best in place. Moreover, she said, the system was transparent and engaging, and thus deserved commendation. “Most of our recommendations, almost 70 per cent of what we tabled, have been embraced; so we commend the government and all the people involved,” said Ms Kabisama. Despite the compliments, Ms Kabisama said Police Forum and TACCEO had earmarked some areas which needed government attention as they needed clear clarifications in order to avoid complaints. She cited the recommendations as including the improvement in the contestants’ voting and announcement of the election results saying they should indicate a specific centre’s name. Plus, all parties must be directed to ensure that all persons with disabilities and those with special needs are given the needed support should they show interest in vying for any post as well as during the voting process. They furthermore proposed that a poll box should be kept at a place where persons with special needs can drop their ballots easily.
