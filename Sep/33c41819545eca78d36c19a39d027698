DEPUTY Minister for Industry and Trade, Engineer Stella Manyanya, has said the use of electronic tax stamp (ETS) management system for excisable products has played a great role in reducing counterfeit products in the local market. The Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) rolled the second phase of ETS management system on August 1, this year, for bottled water, carbonated drinks and other nonalcoholic drinks. Execution of the second phase of ETS followed successful implementation of the first phase which kicked-off on January 15, 2019, which was applied to cigarettes, wines, beers, spirits and all other kinds of alcoholic drinks which are either manufactured in Tanzania or imported. Speaking in an interview recently, Eng. Manyanya explained that before the use of the electronic stamps it was difficult to trace counterfeits since some unscrupulous traders and importers were using forged physical stamps for the goods. “Tanzania just like other countries in the has been fighting hard to protect its products from fake products, curbing such goods can only be possible through coordination of government institutions and other stakeholders,” she explained. Former Minister for Industry and Trade, Mr Charles Mwijage, told the National Assembly when tabling budget estimates for financial year 2018/2019 that curbing counterfeits products was a difficult task since it involved unscrupulous traders and importers with a lot of money.
