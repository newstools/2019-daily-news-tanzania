THE Financial Sector Deepening Trust (FSDT), yesterday launched the campaign dubbed ‘IBUA Youth’ to influence financial service providers and policy makers to encourage youth to save and engage in productive economic activities. Speaking during the launch of IBUA Youth campaign, the FSDT’s Operations Director, Ms Irene Mlola said the campaign seeks to initiate new thinking and enable youth to make good use of available financial services. “The campaign will also help to encourage their behavioral change towards greater awareness of their finance, including the use of available products and services,” she said. According to her, Young Tanzanians, aged between 16-24 years old, face multiple challenges with low levels of education, civic participation, economic activities, wealth and human capital. She said in terms of financial inclusion, youth have remained in the most marginalized socio-economic groups and account for a third of the overall financially excluded population. The FSDT’s Communications Advisor, Ms Neema Mosha said the campaign would use multiple Media outlets to create dialogues among youth on their economic rights and ways to address existing gaps in their access and usage of financial services. “It will discuss their issues with each other and think around solutions. By capturing the voices of the youth and sharing them with financial stakeholders, FSDT aims to drive the development of appropriate formal financial solutions and for the youth market to embrace those solutions, incest in their future and ultimately break the cycle of poverty,” she said. On his part the FSDT’s Executive Director, Mr Sosthenes Kewe said the launch of the campaign marks an important milestone towards various organisations in the financial sector, youth-centered nonprofits and Media Houses working together to develop forward-thinking strategies to encourage the youth to take advantage of the benefits of financial prospects.
