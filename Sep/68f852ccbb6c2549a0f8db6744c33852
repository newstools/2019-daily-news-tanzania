AUTHORITIES in Dodoma are working to control mosquitoes and raise awareness on the diseases they transmit to promote community participation in eliminating breeding sites of Anopheles mosquitoes which transmit the malady. Launching the programme here over the weekend, Dodoma Regional Commissioner, Dr Binilith Mahenge, noted that economic achievement of the country depends on good health of the people. “During independence, Mwalimu (Julius) Nyerere declared three main enemies of the country, namely poverty, ignorance and disease,” remarked the Regional Commissioner (RC) during the launch at Mnadani Ward in Dodoma City. During the event, the DC handed over a book on guidelines and best practices to all seven district commissioners in Dodoma to be used in an exercise to control mosquitoes. The districts are Chamwino, Kongwa, Mpwapwa, Bahi, Kondoa, Chemba and Dodoma. Dr Mahenge said every resident of Dodoma should take part in the exercise to eliminate breeding sites of Anopheles, saying City residents should keep their house compounds clean. He informed them that President John Magufuli had promised, among other things, to build infrastructure providing health services and increase budget on medicine and medical kits during his 2015 campaign. Dr Mahenge said 21 health facilities had been built by the government in Dodoma Region and increased the budget on health services to 4bn/- from 900m/- a year, pointing out the government was constructing three district hospitals of Bahi, Chamwino and Chemba. “President (John) Magufuli also ordered re-allocation of funds for Uhuru celebrations to construct Uhuru Hospital in Dodoma. Plans to put up the hospital are underway,” he said. Dr Mahenge said the government has been conducting a number of initiatives to control the diseases, pointing out among the initiatives as HIV/AIDS testing campaign dubbed ‘Furaha Yangu, Jitambue, Ishi’, nutrition and malaria campaigns.
