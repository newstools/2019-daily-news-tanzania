The High Court today dismissed the application of the opposition leader TunduLissu to oppose the decision to oust him as Singida East ConstituencyMP. Judge Matupa ruled that Lissu's application for prerogative orders against the Speaker of the National Assembly to declare the seat vacant, if successful, would lead into Constitutional crisis. The judge said that already the Constituency has elected legislatorMirajiMtaturu and no one has since opposed his election. He said that if Lissuâ€™s application was to succeed in the ruling, it would install two MPs in the same Constituency that is contrary to the constitution.
