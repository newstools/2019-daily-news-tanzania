THE National Council for Technical Education (Nacte) has reopened a two week window for applicants wishing to join tertiary education for the 2019/ 20 academic year. The move comes a few days after the government directed them to do so to enable the applicants not selected due to a wrong choice of tertiary education programmes. Accordingly, Nacte Head of Admission Twaha Twaha invited eligible applicants to make a good selection of courses based on academic qualifications set by colleges to get admission. “For the second time we invite Form Four and Six leavers with qualifications to utilise this opportunity and apply for various programmes in various tertiary institutions countrywide,” he pointed out. Briefing reporters in Dar es Salaam yesterday, he explained that the second window was opened on September 7- 25. He further clarified that Nacte was verifying 58,193 applicants selected by various institutions and colleges that provided tertiary education and training. Mr Twaha pointed out that verification results together with the ones of those reapplying would be released by October 4 as per the academic calendar. Meanwhile, Tanzania Higher Learning Institutions Students Organisation (Tahliso) Chairman Peter Niboye reminded students of their responsibilities whenever they were at college. “It is important to visit Nacte website from now and then to can access various information that will help solve your problems timely,” he advised.
