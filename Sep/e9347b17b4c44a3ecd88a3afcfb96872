IT was not proper for the Babati District Council to direct residents in the district to stop developing their land close to where a major road will be constructed, the Deputy Minister for Works, Elias Kwandikwa has said. He told Members of Parliament at the on-going Bunge session on Thursday that the district councils were not the proper authorities to issue such orders but Tanzania National Road Agency (TANROADS). “It was not proper for the district council to stop people from developing their land areas. They should wait for instructions from the relevant authority,” he said in his reply to a supplementary question from Ester Mahawe (Special Seats, CCM), who wanted to know why Babati residents have been stopped from developing their areas for three years. Earlier, the special seats lawmaker demanded to know when the government would pay residents of Sina, Hangoni, Kwere and Mruki who were affected in the construction plans for Babati bypass road of the Dodoma–Babati–Arusha and Singida –Babati road. The Deputy Minister said the Babati bypass road project of the Dodoma–Babati– Arusha and Singida–Babati road which will be constructed together with Mtera bypass of the Dodoma–Iringa under financial support of African Development Bank ((AfDB), were at the feasibility study and detailed design and preparation of tender documents. He said one of the responsibilities of a consultant engineer was to identify 
alignment of the bypass road, and after the area where the road would pass were known and approved by the government, then a feasibility study and detailed survey is conducted, where evaluation of areas to be affected will be conducted.
