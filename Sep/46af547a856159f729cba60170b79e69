The East African Community has declared Fridays as ‘Afrika Mashariki Fashion Day’ during which East Africans will wear attires manufactured in the region. The 36th Extra-Ordinary Sectoral Council on Trade, Industry, Finance and Investment (SCTIFI) further declared the 1st Week of September an ‘Afrika Mashariki Fashion Week’ to be held annually as a Trade Fair and Exhibition of EAC designed textiles and garments. The SCTIFI urged EAC Partner States that produce cotton to set up national cotton lint buffer stock mechanisms to ensure all year-round availability of locally produced cotton lint to spinning mills. The Ministerial Session of the 36th SCTIFI which was chaired by Rwanda’s Minister for Trade and Industry, Ms. Soraya M. Hakuziyaremye, approved the Final Draft Cotton, Textile and Apparels (CTA) Strategy and the Implementation Roadmap. In her opening remarks, Ms. Hakuziyaremye said that for the EAC region to reap maximum benefits from the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCTA), it was imperative to enhance the region’s productive capacity. Ms. Hakuziyaremye called for urgent implementation of a number of outstanding EAC Summit decisions and directives especially in the textile, leather and automotive industries, in addition to resolving Non-Tariff Barriers. She reminded the Ministers that AfCTA Summit had directed that the implementation of the agreement should commence by 1st July, 2020 necessitating EAC Partner States to conclude their Tariff Offers by the agreed dates.
