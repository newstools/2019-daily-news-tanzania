ZANZIBAR envoys Malindi are trying to make their comeback in the continental level club tournament aftading from limelight for many years. Malindi face the might of Egyptian Al Masry in their first leg of the CAF Confederation Cup at Amaan Stadium tomorrow. Malindi were promoted to the top flight two seasons, but their comeback was so strong enough to give them a ticket to play in the continental class championship.  “We are well prepared to host them here and we are ready. We Al Masry are a big African team and for us, it is an honour to face them as it provides us with a good opportunity to measure ourselves,” said the team’s Coach Abdulghani Msoma. Ahead of the clash with Al Masry, Msoma said he has studied well his opponents find them to have energetic players. “We respect them as among giants in Egypt but we hope to give them a good match,” he added.   Msoma said he is preparing his players to face the kind of players Al Masry have, hence it won’t be easy for the visitors to overpower his players. Msoma has called upon the team’s supporters and football fans in Zanzibar to rally behind the team during their home and away matches. "Our supporters gave us a commendable support during our encounters with Mogadishu City, we expect them to do the same against Al Masry,” said Msoma. The return leg will take place in a fortnight in Cairo.
