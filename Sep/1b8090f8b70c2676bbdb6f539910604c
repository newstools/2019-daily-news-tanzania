DIRECTOR of Public Prosecutions’ (DPP) office is ready to work on President John Magufuli’s proposal on handling of the economic sabotage suspects’ cases. DPP Biswalo Mganga said in Dar es Salaam yesterday that the proposal was possible, but only if the suspects themselves write letters to his office, through heads of respective prisons, insisting that the letters must be written by the suspects themselves. “The procedure is that the suspect himself/herself is required to write the letter through head of prison, confessing the offence and we will act swiftly. The suspect must write the letter himself/herself and not his/her lawyer. As you know, the lawyer can change and the suspect can deny the lawyer that he/she has not instructed him to write the letter…that’s why the suspect must write with their own handwriting,” the DPP insisted. President John Magufuli, speaking after swearing new appointees at the State House in Dar es Salaam, on Sunday gave DPP Mganga one week to carry out the programme, which will entail meeting the suspects and for those willing to admit, be allowed to pay back the money and set free to continue with their normal lives. But, President Magufuli quickly reminded that his words were mere proposals and should not be perceived as interference with the judicial proceedings. “Relevant authorities should consider this as a suggestion and see if our laws can accommodate it, I have just given a piece of advice…sincerely, I get deeply concerned when I see these suspects being dragged to court, some of them have even fallen ill and whoever sees them can really feel sorry for them,” he remarked, adding: “If there are those who are ready to apologise and return the public money, we are ready to forgive them subject to their promise not to get involved in the dirty deals again.” Since Dr Magufuli came to power in November 2015, a number of government officials and prominent businesspeople have been arrested and charged with economic sabotage and money laundering cases, which are not bailable.
