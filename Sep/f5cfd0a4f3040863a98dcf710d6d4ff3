CRDB has rekindled its commitment to clients with a new year-long campaign centred at boosting the country’s economic growth. The bank over the weekend introduced the campaign that will bring its various services closer to clients and revitalize its commitment to playing a key role in boosting development growth endeavours. The lender seeks to double its efforts in issuance of services that meet the needs and requirements of customers across their age, gender and income level groups after redefining it’s campaign ‘Ulipo Tupo’ – loosely translated as ‘Where ever you are, we are also there’. “The campaign seeks to assure our clients that ‘Ulipo- Tupo’ is not just a slogan but rather, our commitment to them as we show that we will always be there to issue a hand whenever needed so that they can achieve their objectives,” said CRDB’s Chief Commercial Officer, Dr Joseph Witts. During the campaign, the bank will showcase its presence to its clients across their age groups, focusing primarily on why they should raise their savings to meet their future plans. “The bank has Junior Jumbo for children, teenagers, we have Teen Account, students- -Scholar Account,” He said during the launch of new campaign. Dr Witts said after being employed, “we have Salary Account. For women, we have Malkia Account and retirees, we have Retirees Account while businesspeople have their own Current Account”. The bank will also comprehensively market its loan products, focusing primarily on informing “wananchi” that those in need of loans could easily get them from CRDB and achieve their aspirations. “Our personal loan carries an interest of 16 per cent being (one) of the most affordable in the market,” Dr Witts said.
