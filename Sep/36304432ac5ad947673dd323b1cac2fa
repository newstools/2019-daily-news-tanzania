TANZANIA is poised to assume the Eastern Africa Police Chiefs Cooperation Organisation’s (EAPCCO) reign at a meeting of top police bosses here next week. Inspector General of Police (IGP) Simon Sirro is expected to take over the baton from his Sudanese counterpart Abil Mohammed Ahmed Bashair at the 21st EAPCCO Annual General Assembly (AGA). Police Spokesman David Misime told the ‘Daily News’ here yesterday that the stage was set for the high profile meeting, which features IGPs from 13 countries. President John Magufuli is scheduled to officiate at the 21st EAPCCO AGA, Mr Misime said. “Preparations of the high level meeting are in top gear, with all the police chiefs having confirmed to attend,” explained the police spokesman. During the four-day meeting, the IGPs will deliberate on a number of issues that seek to bolster security in the region with a view of stepping up efforts in curbing cross border and transitional crimes in the region. The top police chiefs are also expected to tour the Ngorongoro Conservation Area to sample the natural attractions as part of their stay in the country.Established in 1998, EAPCCO was founded as a regional response to fight transnational and organised crime. With 13 members to its name, EAPCCO is charged with carrying out regular reviews of joint crime management strategies in view of changing national, regional needs and priorities. Only nine out of the 13 EAPCCO member states have signed the agreement on extradition of fugitives and sentenced criminals. With its secretariat based in Nairobi, the chairmanship of EAPPCO rotates among its member countries on annual basis. EAPCCO member countries are Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Uganda, Seychelles, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Comoros Islands and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
