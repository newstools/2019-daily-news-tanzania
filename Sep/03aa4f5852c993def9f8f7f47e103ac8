MINISTER of State in the Prime Minister’s Office (Parliamentary Affairs, Labour Youth, Employment and Persons with Disabilities), Jenista Mhagama has urged women in the country to utilise opportunities in various sectors of the economy. Speaking during the 2nd annual leadership conference in Dar es Salaam yesterday, Ms Mhagama said women shouldn’t hesitate to utilise such opportunities as they were capable of doing any specific job. “Women should trust in themselves and utilise available opportunities for they are capable of doing many things. The government is creating an enabling environment for all people, including women,” she said. The conference’s theme is “The future of work for women is the workplace policy ready”. Ms Mhagama noted that the government would ensure women were included in all economic activities. She congratulated the Association of Tanzania Employers (ATE), on seeing the importance of this programme. “The government will take that idea and advise the private sector on available opportunities.” ATE Chairperson Jayne Nyimbo said the aim of the conference was to highlight and discuss challenges facing women, opportunities and share experience. She further said conference activities included awarding certificates to 20 graduates in three cohorts of the Female Future Programme, which involved women participants from nine companies. She added that the programme started in 2016 and about 111 women had graduated so far. “Training covers leadership, efficiency across the board and efficiency in implementation,” she noted. Norwegian Ambassador to Tanzania Elisabeth Jacobsen said they strongly believed in the women agenda and Tanzania could gain a lot from the programme. Eastern and Southern African Management Institute (ESAMI), Representative, Chengetai Magunje said the programme would enhance work to women and overcome fear so that they could play their part in leadership.
