PRIME Minister Kassim Majaliwa has invited Cuban investors to come and invest in the country’s agriculture sector especially in sugarcane farming. The Premier said that Cuba has made great strides in sugar production and invited investors from the country to come and cooperate with Tanzanian government to increase sugar production, improve sugarcane farming and establish sugar factories. Mr Majaliwa made the remark in Dodoma yesterday during his talks with the Cuban First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Marcelino Medina González. The PM commended the Cuban government for its good cooperation with Tanzania in promoting social development. “Tanzania and Cuba have a historic cooperation… we are aware of the good cooperation between the two countries since the first phase government under the late President Mwalimu Julius Nyerere and former Cuban President the late Fidel Castro,” Mr Majaliwa said. He said the government will continue strengthening cooperation between the two countries because Cuba was among the countries with long-term cooperation with Tanzania on health, political, economic and social issues. “For example in health sector, a number of Cuban doctors have been visiting Tanzania to provide services to patients with various complications and the government of Cuba has been providing various opportunities for Tanzanians to pursue medical studies in Cuba,” he said. He also invited Cuban investors to invest in tourism sector especially on beaches, citing V aradero City in Cuba, which he said receives over one million tourists annually and it was depending only on beaches with 22 kilometres as tourist attraction. Mr Gonzalez said his government will ensure that its cooperation with Tanzania will be sustained. He also commended efforts by Tanzanian government to promote development and economic growth. He commended Tanzania for opening an embassy in Cuba, saying the office has further helped to cement the bilateral ties.
