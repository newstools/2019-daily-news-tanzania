DODOMA District CCM Political Committee members are satisfied with the new Dodoma Regional Bus Terminal construction. DODOMA District Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) Chairman, Mr Robert Mwinje, has expressed satisfaction with the ongoing construction work of the new Dodoma Regional Bus Terminal at Nzuguni area on the outskirts of Dodoma City. The project to put up the new Dodoma Regional Bus Terminal, which is executed by a contractor, Mohamed Builders, is set to be complete by the end of this year. The project kicked off mid last year. Mr Mwinje made the remarks during a recent visit of District Political Committee of CCM to the project site, saying residents of Dodoma should take care of the new bus terminal upon its completion. “Upon completion of the construction project, the city dwellers should take care of the bus terminal so that it can last long,” said the District Party leader who was head of the delegation of District Political Committee members of the CCM during the tour. The tour also took the Political Committee members to another ongoing construction project of a recreation park at Chinangali in the city. The park will provide the residents with leisure, entertainment and recreational pursuits. Mr Mwinje used the occasion to invite business operators to Dodoma to invest in the projects to generate income because Dodoma is now a growing city. He commended President John Magufuli and the fifth phase government for the ongoing mega projects in the country. “May I use this opportunity to congratulate President John Magufuli for the mega projects in various parts of the country,” he said
