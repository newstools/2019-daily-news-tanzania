THE government is planning to administer Measles and Rubella vaccines to over eight million children countrywide in a campaign slated to kick off the last week of this month in a move aimed at averting negative health consequences. Other four million children aged nine to 18 months will receive polio vaccines in the same period. Immunisation Programme Manager at the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, Dr Dafroza Lyimo revealed this during the Vaccination Orientation and training on Measles and Rubella campaign in Tanzania organized by her ministry in cooperation with the Lions Club of Tanzania in Dar es Salaam yesterday. “The four-day campaign will be launched on 26th through 30th this month countrywide, and it is targeting the set aim of reaching more than 95 percent of all children to help them grow up healthy through avoiding negative health complications which may emerge for the ones who are not being vaccinated for protection,” Dr Lyimo said at the sideline of the training session. She went on revealing that the measles and rubella vaccination campaign will go concurrently with that of polio to nearly four million children in the country, who did not get the vaccination for various reasons so as to make sure that no one is left behind and become vulnerable to consequences. On his part, The Council Chairman of the Lions Club, Mr Shabbirhusein Khalfan said that his club was happy to partner with the Ministry in advocating, sensitizing and mobilizing the general community to immunize children as a way of promoting up a healthy nation. “For us (Lions Club), the health of the people comes first. After this one day training to our members from different parts of the country, we will enter into streets, public gatherings and houses of worship with brochures, booklets and other communication tactics to spread the word to people to show up with their children when the vaccinating campaign kicks off,” he said . He called for parents and all citizens to avoid rumors and take their children for vaccination, adding that they should go for special medical experts in case they need clarifications rather than relying on misleading statements from unqualified individuals.
