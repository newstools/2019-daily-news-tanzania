TEN coaches from Dar es Salaam are expected to benefit from the two-day Unified Coach training set to begin today at the National Stadium in the city. Dar es Salaam is the the last region to host the training after having been successfully conducted in Mwanza, Tanga, Morogoro and Mtwara with massive turnout of participants. The training which is specifically targeting Primary School coaches, who will be on the centre stage to implement the upcoming Play Unified, Learn Unified initiative with funding from Stavros Niarchos Foundation (SNF). The project aims at integrating people with intellectual disabilities with their normal counterparts through sports as a tool to fast track social inclusion and in the same process, do away with segregation. Briefing the ‘Daily News’ yesterday, Special Olympics Tanzania (SO-T) National Director Charles Rays said in all the regions they have visited, they were received well by their hosts, something he said, contributed much to the smooth running of the training. “As far as imparting the necessary skills to the intended coaches is concerned, most of them (coaches) were willing to learn new things and that is what keep us believing that the project is being implemented perfectly,” he said. Moreover, Rays called upon parents and guardians of intellectual challenged people to let them socialize with their friends as one way of enhancing inclusive culture while insisting that hiding them will not do any good. Through the Play Unified, Learn Unified project, two games which are Volleyball and Football will be played in five selected primary schools from five regions across the country involving intellectual challenged pupils together with their normal friends.
