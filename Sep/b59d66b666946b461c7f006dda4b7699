THE government has warned greedy traders, who exploit small-scale farmers by overloading sacks through a method called ‘lumbesa’ and directed the use of proper weight measurements. Besides the warning, Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa directed all authorities to ensure they observed proper measurements, noting that overloading denied farmers their due prices. Mr Majaliwa directed regional and district commissioners to ensure ‘lumbesa’ business was banned in their jurisdictions. He said during his recent tour of Karatu, especially in Eyasi, farmers complained about greedy traders, who were imposing their own packaging measurements to profit from poor farmers. Mr Majaliwa said there was an urgent need for grow ers to unite and resist pressure, decoy, tricks and baits from traders, who preferred sacks to scales to avoid buying produce in kilogrammes. He said such traders exploited farmers without considering the money they had invested in farming. He directed cooperative officers and other responsible authorities to ensure the packaging method reflected the exact produce weight. He explained that to get capital farmers borrowed money to buy improved seeds and farm inputs and insisted that it was unfair to exploit them. Mr Majaliwa noted that ‘lumbesa’ problem still existed, but urged traders to be fair to farmers because they too wanted to make profit from what they had worked for. He gave this warning following Mr Rashid Shangazi (Mlalo-CCM)’s question, who wanted to know initiatives taken by the government to ensure traders respected proper measures instead of the ‘lumbesa’ method, which derailed farmers’ efforts to improve their livelihoods. Mr Shangazi called for a nationwide campaign against the ‘lumbesa’ method, instead only proper weight measurements and packaging should be used.
