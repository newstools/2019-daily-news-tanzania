THE Minister for Health has said that plans are underway to start kidney dialysis services at Abdalla Mzee Hospital in Pemba, hopefully by next year. The statement from Deputy Minister for Health, Harusi Said Suleiman was in response to some legislators who raised concern over lack of dialysis services in Pemba, subjecting patients to undue inconvenience. "We are now improving a room to be used for the dialysis services and installing some equipment. The room may be ready by November this year," Ms Said informed the House yesterday during question and answer session. The deputy minister thanked development partners for supporting government's efforts to improve health services delivery in the country, mentioning that one of them has promised to donate kidney dialysis machine for Pemba. Dialysis is the process of removing excess water, solutes and toxins from the blood in people whose kidneys can no longer perform the functions naturally. This is referred to as renal replacement therapy.
