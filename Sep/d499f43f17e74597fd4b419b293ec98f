THE National Assembly was yesterday told that National Environment Management Council (NEMC) should be commended for timely issuance of certificates on environmental impact assessment (EIA) and enabling the government to implement development projects as planned. Minister for Works, Transport and Communications Isaac Kamwelwe noted that timely issuance of certificates had facilitated the implementation of development projects in many parts of the country like in  Sindano, Lupajo, Lipumburu, Mchauru and Mapili wards near  Tanzania’s border with Mozambique. The minister was responding to Lulindi MP Jerome Bwanausi (CCM), who in his question wanted to know the progress of the implementation of development projects. The minister was visiting Mtwara Coal plant. President John Magufulu called on NEMC to issue EIA certificates on time. “Honourable Speaker, I want to report to your House that since then NEMC has been issuing certificates on time. Complaints about late issuance of the certificates are now history.  We have every reason to commend NEMC for this positive change,” Mr Kamwelwe told the House. He said development projects were being implemented in time because the government has removed many of the challenges that undermined implementation efforts.
