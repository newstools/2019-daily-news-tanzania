ESCALATING cases of immo- rality among the East African youth has ravaged communities in the region; hence parents are responsible for making them adhere to the right ways of liv- ing. That was among the hot- test issues widely discussed in the convention of Ahamadiyya Muslims of Tanzania held at Kitonga Ward in Dar es Salaam over the weekend. The meeting held to mark the 50 years of Ahmadiyya Muslims Community‘s ser- vices to Tanzanians, was at- tended by envoys from Kenya, Uganda, Mozambique, Malawi and Pakistan. An envoy from Uganda, Amir Sahib, said he witnessed a rising number of youth en- gaged in spot betting and its associated forms of gambling as a problem that needs inter- vention. “Everything should start with parents since they are the ones who prepare a child how to live and behave when he or she grows up,” he said before the audience of 6,000 people in Dar es Salaam. The leader of the Ahmadi- yya Community in Tanza- nia, Sheikh Tahir Mahmood Chaudhry, added that a good citizen, regardless his or her re- ligious nature, is the one who fears God and engages in good things and forbids wrongdo- ings. Sheikh Chaudhry said the Ahmadiyya Community had to prove its mettle only through service to the Tanzanian man- kind in a very broad spectrum, in the spiritual realm, the intel- lectual realm, the social realm, the ideological realm and the material realm.
