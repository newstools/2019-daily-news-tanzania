EXTRA efforts remain vital for our envoys in the continental level championship Young Africans who have been drawn against Egypt’s Pyramids as their last hurdle towards the Group Stage of CAF Confederation Cup. With Egyptian teams phobia still haunting our envoys, we would like again and again to warn players have to forget the past records by kicking out the Pyramids and gallantly sail into the group stage. Clearing the Egyptian hurdle would be big a relief to Yanga fans and Tanzanians as the team will be playing in the higher class tournament that draws global attention. While we encourage Yanga to achieve their goal, we would like to caution the club, players and coaches that they need better preparations for the play-off since they are facing a tougher and well drilled team. From what we have seen their previous encounters against Township Rollers and Zesco United, Yanga need serious reinforcement, especially in finishing and left back-line. It has been clearly noted that the absence of players, who previously guided the team to success, is a big blow as it disrupted the whole team’s winning machinery. Yanga are yet to find effective replacement for Gadiel Michael, Heritier Makambo and Thabani Kamusoko who were the club’s pillar heads. Hence, nothing short of hard work, determination and extra skills display will help our envoys to get good results and advance further. The pep talk is over now after other envoys; Simba, KMKM who were playing in CAF Championship League, Azam, KMC and Malindi who were playing in CAF Confederation Cup, are all out leaving Yanga alone on the race. We challenge Yanga to aim higher this time around. A big margin win is all they need against Pyramids to put themselves in a comfortable zone of reaching the group stage. All the best Yanga we rally behind you and wish you the best of luck.
