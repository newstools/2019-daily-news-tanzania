COAST Regional Industrial Exhibition and Investment Forum event which was set to start today has been moved to October 7. Regional Commissioner Eng. Evarist Ndikilo told reporters that the decision was reached by the organizing committee purposely to ensure the exhibitions attract more participants. “So far 173 companies have confirmed to participate in the event, but our focus is to bring as many companies as possible,” he noted. Likewise, he said, 400 companies had showed their interest to participate in the Regional Investment Forum and that at least 150 of them have confirmed their participation. He said the organizing committee has decided to reschedule the event to October 7 so as to give more chance to various companies to register and set up their businesses for exhibition and trade. He applauded the Tanzania Standard Newspapers (TSN) for the good coverage, which focuses on highlighting various investment and business opportunities available in the region. In addition to that, already several financial institutions have confirmed their participation including CRDB which will be the main sponsor of the event.
