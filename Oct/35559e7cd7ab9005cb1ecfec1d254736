NATIONAL economy grew by 7.2 per cent in the second quarter of 2019, up from 6.1 per cent in the same period last year. Construction, mining and communications sectors bolstered the growth, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Growth improved after slowing to 6.6 per cent in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 7.5 per cent in the same period in the previous year, due to shrinking growth in construction, agriculture and manufacturing activities. The bureau said in its report that construction sector recorded the highest growth of 19.6 per cent in the second quarter from 5.2 per cent in the corresponding period in 2018. In the first quarter, the sector which is the biggest driver of GDP grew by 13.2 per cent compared with 15.6 per cent, a year ago. It was followed by the mining sector, which posted the 17.2 per cent growth compared to 6.8 per cent recorded during the similar quarter in 2018 while information and communication sector recorded 10.3 per cent growth rate in the second quarter of 2019, down from 12.4 per cent in the corresponding period in 2018, the bureau said. Growth in the mining sector had rebounded to 10 per cent in the first quarter of 2019 from 5.7 per cent decline during the same period in 2018. NBS attributed growth in construction to an increase in domestic production of construction materials like cement, iron and steels that are proxy of construction activities. The growth in the mining sector was mainly because of an increase in production of gold, coal, and diamond, with gold production increasing to 10,683 kilogrammes in the second quarter of 2019 from 9,539 kilogrammes in the corresponding quarter of 2018. Production of coal increased to 181,236 tonnes in the second quarter of 2019 from 160,367 tonnes in similar quarter of 2018. Commenting, Professor Honest Ngowi of Mzumbe University said the rapid growth in construction sector could be attributed to heavy public investment in energy and transport infrastructure projects, including construction of the standard gauge railway and Rufiji hydropower project. The government is constructing the 2,561 kilometre standard gauge railway linking Dar es Salaam port with Mwanza on Lake Victoria and Kigoma on Lake Tanganyika as well as neighbouring Rwanda and Burundi. Construction of the first phase from Dar es Salaam to Morogoro, covering 300 kilometres is scheduled for completion next month. The government also launched construction of the 2,100MW Rufiji hydropower project on Rufiji River in Coast Region in July this year. The project is expected to add 2,115 megawatts upon completion in 2022 to help the nation meet future energy demands of the semi-industrialised economy it aspires to build. The government also inaugurated a new state-of-the-art terminal at Julius Nyerere International Airport in August to handle international flights as part of the country’s bid to position itself as the regional aviation hub. “The government is putting so much money into infrastructure development which triggers growth. However, that growth should help to reduce poverty, generate income and conserve the environment,” said Professor Ngowi. “It is good to celebrate but we must ask ourselves if this is income generating, poverty reduction and green growth,” he said.
