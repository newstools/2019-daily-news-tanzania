TEN people have died in a road accident after a vehicle they were travelling in plunged into a bridge, which was swept by water at Sindeni area in Handeni District following the ongoing heavy rains. Police reports say the accident occurred early Saturday and that passengers who were travelling along the Dar es Salaam-Arusha highway were stranded after some bridges were flooded or washed away by floods in Sindeni area. Tanga Regional Police Commander Edward Bukombe said that the accident occurred after a driver passed the flooded area without knowing that a bridge had been destroyed by the floods. Last week 11 people died when their houses collapsed due to heavy rain while others drowned. Flooded areas in Tanga include the Tanga-Segera section at the Hale bridge, the Segera-Korogwe section at Mandera bridge and Kilole area at the Korogwe- Handeni junction. Other areas were Korogwe- Handeni road at Komsala and Sindeni bridge, Handeni-Kilindi road at Mabalanga and Handeni- Turiani road at Kideleko. In Muheza District, a road connecting Amani Division and Muheza towns was also rendered impassable. Mid this month heavy rains that pounded Tanga Region left five people dead, 120 displaced and the road infrastructure gravely damaged. Korogwe District Commissioner Kissa Gwakisa and Korogwe Rural MP Timotheo Mzava were among officials who toured the affected areas. Ms Gwakisa said at least five children were among ten residents of Magunga-Mzia village in Foroforo Ward who were swept away by floods after their house was demolished.
