THE Rukwa Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr Joachim Wangabo, has expressed his anger over failure by Laela water project valued at over 4.5bn/- to serve residents despite being completed three years ago. The project was implemented by Fally Enterprises. Vividly angered, the RC over the weekend briefed the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Kangi Lugola on the acute shortage of safe and clean water supply to 21,068 residents of small town of Laela in Sumbawanga District Council. Equally, Mr Lugola was briefed that recently the Laela Water Project was sabotaged by arsonists who allegedly set ablaze the room that housed batteries and other requisite equipment purchased at a high cost. Three suspected arsonists were arrested for interrogation. The minister was further briefed that the Laela Water Project valued at over 4.5 bn/ whose construction took off in November 2015 and completed the following year, has all 33 water stations dry since then. “Strangely, drops of water could be seen trickling from some of the water station only when senior government officials, including ministers, deputy ministers, DCs and RCs visit” added the RC. Mr Wangabo told the minister that contractor Fally Enterprises allegedly sabotaged seven key water projects in the region, including the Laela Water Project valued at over 4.5 bn/-, subsequently occasioning a colossal loss of billions of shillings, which is tax payers money. “I have impeccable reports that Fally Enterprises bribed some dishonest government officials, including those from the Ministry of Water and Irrigation so that they can be awarded the tender. Worse still, all projects are sub- contracted,”explained the RC.
