MORE than 30 percent of women who showed up for breast screening at Muhimbili National hospital (MNH)’s Mloganzila branch were found to have developed some breast cancer signs. The hospital’s senior radiologist, Dr Lulu Sakafu, said the women who were found to be having the signs will have to undergo intensive screening before further steps are taken to save their lives. “We call upon all women in the country to show up at MNHMloganzila Branch to attend the free checkups and be trained on how to check themselves if they have any signs of breast cancer and subsequently get treatment at early stages, because if early interventions are made, the disease can be easily cured,” Said Dr Sakafu. She said that the hospital which decided to run a two day free breast cancer screening, in line with the cancer awareness month, had witnessed 120 women attending the hospital for check up. Thirty nine of them were found with some signs, prompting intensive screening to detect whether they were suffering from cancer or some other related ailments in their breasts. Breast cancer ranked the second among all types of cancer cases reported in the country after cervical cancer, but there was a possibility of treating it completely if early screaming is effected, according to Dr Sikudhani Muya, a senior Oncologist at Ocean Road Cancer Institute (ORCI), and a member of the Medical Women Association of Tanzania (MEWATA). Dr Muya allayed fears of breast cancer being incurable, saying; “Currently, various forms of cancer, including breast cancer, can be treated at ORCI in Dar es salaam and Bugando hospital in Mwanza. Depending on how intensive cancer has developed, currently we use chemotherapy and radiation therapy to completely cure the disease.” She also hinted men were not spared, as global statistics show that among at least one per cent of global breast cancer cases were men; therefore they should also develop habit of checking their breast regularly.
