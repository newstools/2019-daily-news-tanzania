DEPUTY Minister for Finance and Economic Planning Dr Ashatu Kijaji has issued two and half months ultimatum to the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA), prepare and submit the list of taxpayers, the number of residential and commercial property and billboards in Dar es Salaam Region in order to have the correct statistics of taxpayers. Dr Kijaji made the directives during her visits to the TRA-Temeke Tax Region in Dar es Salaam yesterday to inspect how the Authority’s implement its daily responsibilities and identify challenges impeding revenue collection. She added, although the taxman has managed to increase revenue collection to 1.78tri/-in September, the amount is still very low compared to people’s positive response of paying tax. Dr Kijaji said the aim of preparing and presenting the new taxpayers statistics follows the distribution of small entrepreneur identification cards by President John Magufuli in order to widen the tax base. On property tax, Dr Kijaji directed TRA to make sure it prepares list of all residential and commercial property, owners and their contracts in order to develop database that will ease revenue collection. “To increase property tax collections, TRA should work day and night to make sure the database is complete on time that will be used to remind taxpayers through mobile SMS as it is done in the Ministry of Land, Housing and Human Settlements Development, thus boosting tax collection,” she noted. In the same manner, Dr Kijaji directed TRA to inspect all users of Electronic Fiscal Devices (EFD), machines for business people in Temeke to make sure the issuance of receipts is observed. Earlier, Temeke Tax Region Manager, Mr Paul Walalaze said the region has 437,539 taxpayers and in 2018/19 the region collected 328.5bn/-, equivalent to 85 per cent of the targets set of collecting 395bn/-. “We also managed to collect 1.4bn/- property tax out of 1.6bn/-targets, billboard tax of 2.2bn/-out of 2.3bn/- targets, equivalent to 87 per cent and 95 per cent targets.
