MINISTRY of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children has refuted rumours circulating on social media that Minister Ummy Mwalimu will launch a pharmacy selling penis enlargement drugs. According to a press statement released by the ministry yesterday, the government has its own procedure to inform members of the public of official functions and the discharge of public leaders’ duties. “There is no truth whatsoever on the rumours circulating on social media that the minister will launch the pharmacy. Neither did she visit one nor does she know any of that nature,” reads part of the statement signed by Head of Communications Unit of the Ministry Gerald Chami. It points out that the ministry urges members of the public to ignore the rumours on social media that suggest to customers to order the drugs through the company’s mobile phone number. “We call on members of the public to be cautious against such reports on social media networks. This is one of the biggest fraudulence in the country,” it says. The statement notes that the ministry in conjunction with security organs and the Tanzania Medicines and Medical Devices Authority (TMDA) are following up on the reports to take legal action against those forwarding such false message on social media networks. “Legal action will be taken against the culprits of the false message on social media networks,” it says. It states further that the ministry wishes to apologise to all members of the public who have experienced any inconveniences due to such false message.
