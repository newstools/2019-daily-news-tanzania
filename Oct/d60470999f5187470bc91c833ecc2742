IN a move to ensure reliable communication services in the industrial sector in Coast Region, TTCL Corporation has continued to offer special packages for industries in the region. Company's Assistant Regional Manager (Commercial), Mr Anthony Leonce told the 'Daily News' at the ongoing Regional Industrial Exhibition in Kibaha Town that, already 15 industries are receiving communications special packages which has helped a lot in simplifying communication since the charges are more affordable. " These industries are located in the industrial areas of Mji Mdogo, Lulanzi and Zegereni in Kibaha town," he said adding that plans are underway to connect four industries in Mapinga area in Bagamoyo district with the services. In addition to that, the company is in the last preparations for the implementation of wireless Radio Broad Band (RBB) services in Zegereni area which will be using Fiber Optic Cables (FOC) means of transmission instead of Copper wires. Expounding, he pointed out that this is due to the fact that Fiber Optic Cable have unlimited capacity for waves transmission while Copper wires have the capacity for only four megabytes per second (mps). Meanwhile, the Company is expecting to launch RBB, 4G internet services and a customer service shop at Mlandizi division in Kibaha District early next month.
