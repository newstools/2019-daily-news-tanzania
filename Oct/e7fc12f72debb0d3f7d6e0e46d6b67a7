MINISTER for Home Affairs, Kangi Lugola has directed Rukwa Regional Police Commander (RPC) Mathias Nyanda to ensure four men alleged to have impregnated schoolgirls from Kalambo District are arrested and prosecuted. The minister directed police officers also to quest parents and guardians bent to hide the names of the culprits. Mr Lugola gave such directives after being informed that about 19 cases of early pregnancy had been reported to police stations in Kalambo District and that four suspects had fled to the neighbouring Zambia for fear of being arrested and prosecuted. He was briefed on the incidents in Matai Town before addressing a rally. The minister is in Rukwa Region on a four-day tour. Equally, Rukwa Regional Commissioner (RC), Joachim Wangabo recently said 397 cases of early pregnancy had been reported to police stations in Rukwa Region from January 2018 to August this year. He further noted that the early pregnancy rate in the region was at an alarming rate so something serious should be done to address the challenge. A veteran politician, Dr Chrisant Mzindakaya, suggested that comprehensive research should be conducted to find out reasons for an upward trend in early pregnancy in Rukwa Region.
