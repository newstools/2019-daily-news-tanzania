THE Sheikh Amri Abeid Stadium was transformed into battle field on Monday morning during a match between the Arusha Football Club and Green Warriors of Dar es Salaam. The game started at about 9.30 in the morning, at the stadium. As it happened, the event was a return leg match between AFC and the army team of Green Warriors, playing in the First Division League. The initial game was played last Saturday but got cut shot by pouring rains and therefore organizers decided to re-schedule it to Monday morning. AFC managed to beat Green Warriors 1-0 in the goal scored by Agib Mohammed in the 37th minute of the match and this is where the trouble started. The FDL match referee, Musa Maswaga from Dodoma whistled to affirm the score. The referee was being assisted by two linesmen, Emmanuel Muga and Mohammed Domi both from Morogoro as well as the fourth official, Jackson Samuel from Arusha.
