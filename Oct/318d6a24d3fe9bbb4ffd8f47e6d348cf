INJURY hit KMC have revealed that they will go into the market during the 2020 January transfer window to reinforce squad with worthy players. The Dar es Salaam based side has a long list of players nursing injuries; A situation they say has contributed much to their poor start in the ongoing Premier League season. From four matches played, KMC sit on the 16th slot with 4 points and will take on JKT Tanzania in their next Premier League match on October 23rd. But in his words, KMC Head Coach, Jackson Mayanja admitted that they have about seven players who are nursing injuries and most of them are likely to be out of action for a long time. “To be honest, we have a serious problem of injuries, most of our players have picked injuries and for the time being, we will try to upgrade some players from our junior team to see if they can fit,” he said. Moreover, the former Simba SC coach said bearing in mind that there are many competitions coming ahead, the only way to ensure the team’s perfect rhythm is to be active during the transfer window. KMC performed well in the last season’s league finishing at the top four place behind Azam, Young Africans and Simba, The position earned them an opportunity to play in the CAF Confederation Cup. Under the then Burundian trainer, Etienne Ndayiragije, KMC was one of the best teams of the last season despite being among the league debutants. However, despite the going being tough for them, KMC will soon have their own stadium where home matches will be staged as lately confirmed by the club’s chairman Benjamin Sitta. Sitta said the construction of the 5,000-capacity stadium will soon begin. He added that plans to construct a football academy are in the pipeline where talented players from schools will be groomed while parents and guardians who think they have talented children will be allowed to take them to the academy.
