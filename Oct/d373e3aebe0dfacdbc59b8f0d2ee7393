TARIME District Council has shifted activities from Tarime Town to Nyamwaga village as its new headquarters to implement President John Magufuli’s recent directive. “The President (Dr John Magufuli) gave us 30 days and I have implemented the President’s directive today (Monday) in 15 days, “ said Tarime District Council Executive Director (DED) Mr Apoo Castro Tindwa, while addressing reporters at his new office at Nyamwaga village. The Head of State recently ordered all Councils operating away from where they are supposed to be based to move to their headquarters, in order to take services close to the citizens. Equally, Mr Tindwa instructed all civil servants of the council to look for houses around at Nyamwaga village, with a warning that no one will be left to stay in Tarime town and continue to be regarded as their staff. “On my side I shifted to stay at Nyamwaga yesterday and I am giving 30 days as grace period to all workers to look for houses here at Nyamwaga so that they can deliver to the citizens of Tarime District Council,” Mr Tindwa directed. Nyamwaga village is about 38 kilometres drive from Tarime town. The area has a vast fertile land suitable for cultivation of various cash and food crops such as Arabica coffee, maize, bananas, tea, sunflower, cassava and millet, just to mention a few. It is also home to North Mara Gold Mine and other many small scale miners, besides some council, which border the world’s famous Serengeti National Park.
