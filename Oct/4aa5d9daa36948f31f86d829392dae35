Over 65 people have been killed and dozens wounded after a passenger train erupted in flames in central Pakistan on Thursday, Punjab province Health Minister Dr Yasmin Rashid told the local media. Television footage showed flames pouring out of the carriages as people could be heard crying in the incident near Rahim Yar Khan District in the province. "According to information reaching us from site of the accident, more than 65 people were killed and over 40 injured," Dr Rashid said. The wounded passengers rushed to hospitals in the nearby city of Bahawalpur and elsewhere in Rahim Yar Khan District, she said, added that only 18 of the bodies were identifiable. Local media reported that some passengers were cooking breakfast when the cylinder exploded. In July, at least 23 people were killed in the same district when a passenger train coming from the eastern city of Lahore rammed into a goods train that had stopped at a crossing.
