TANZANIA Ports Authority (TPA) is determined to grab a lion’s share of land-locked countries’ cargo handling business that is thriving in the East African region. The authority is especially targeting the land-locked countries in the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The Dar es Salaam port handles five million tons of Zambian cargo, 4.8 million tons for the Democratic Republic of Congo, one million tons for Rwanda as well as 400,000 and 500,000 tons for Burundi and Malawi, respectively. Over 90 per cent of Burundi imports and exports pass through Dar es Salaam port. TPA Director General Deusdedit Kakoko said the Burundian cargo at the Dar es Salaam port has increased from the previous 65 per cent. The Democratic Republic of Congo accounts for 35 per cent of all transit cargo passing through the Dar es Salaam port, with Zambia Rwanda, Burundi, Malawi and Uganda accounting for 30, 19, seven, six and three per cent, respectively. Engineer Kakoko, speaking to editors and reporters in Dar es Salaam over the weekend, said the authority, capitalising on its major port of Dar es Salaam, is determined to attract all car importers in the SADC region to use the facility as their ideal port. “We want all imported vehicles destined for SADC countries to pass here,” Eng Kakoko stated, emphasising that the Dar es Salaam port so far performs well in serving the member states of both regional blocs. He outlined a number of measures that the authority has taken to lure more importers and exporters from the SADC countries, citing improved customer care. He said some importers and exporters had snubbed the Dar es Salaam port due to the mistreatments they faced from some port or government officials. The TPA has also significantly reduced bureaucracy among its officials and stakeholders, with installation of electronic systems. “We have moved from paper-based methods for some works and we are still working hard towards total paperless operations…from December next year, we will possibly have phased out papers, this will definitely improve our efficiency,” he said. Installation of cameras at 50-metre intervals within the port has enhanced security and helped to increase the number of imported vehicles. Generally, the amount of cargo through the port has for the past three years been maintaining an upward trend. Statistics indicate that in 2016/17, the port handled 14.8 million tons and the figure rose to 16.2 and 17.2 million tons in 2017/18 and 2018/19, respectively. Engineer Kakoko said the authority targets to increase the handled cargo by at least one million ton annually to reach 20 million tons by 2021. On the part of all imported vehicles, the port currently handles less than 200,000 vehicles per year but the target is to handle 600,000 vehicles by 2021. Vehicles handled in 2018/19 were 159,939, an increase from 132,035 vehicles in the previous year. Vessels docking at the port have increased from 2,983 in 2017/18 to 3,293 last fiscal year, thanks to on-going expansion project to construct some new berths.
