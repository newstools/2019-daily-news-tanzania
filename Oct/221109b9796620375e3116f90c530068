BANK of Tanzania (BoT) yesterday cautioned members of public against a Facebook fake account impersonating as Central Bank Governor Professor Florens Luoga. The banking sector regulator condemned the masquerade, which it described as violation of the Facebook’s policy against impersonation. The central bank said in a statement yesterday that the governor has never opened the Facebook account and asked the public to ignore whatever is posted on the account named Florence Luoga, with the photos BoT Governor. “The Bank of Tanzania would like to announce to the public that Governor Florens Luoga has not opened Facebook account contrary to reports and photos seen on the network with his name. For this information, we would like to ask the public to ignore whatever is posted on the account with the fake name of Florence Luoga, using various photos of the governor contrary to the law,” it said. Facebook’s community standards forbid users from using other peoples’ images to deceive or mislead people about the origin of the content. The central bank said it was sympathising with victims of the imposter and had instituted legal measures against the person or people behind the account. “The central bank would like to say sorry to all people who in one way or another have been negatively affected from what has been posted in the fake Facebook account, including using the name of the Governor to con or even hurl insults,” the bank said. “With this information, legal measures continue to identify the criminal who uses the account to defame Prof Luoga.” Prof Luoga who was Deputy Vice Chancellor-Academic of the University of Dar es Salaam was appointed as central bank governor in October 2017. He was also appointed by President John Magufuli as chairman of the board of directors of the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA).
