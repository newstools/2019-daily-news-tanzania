PERMANENT Secretary in the Ministry of State in the Prime Minister's Office, Policy and Investment, Ms Dorothy Mwaluko, has urged people living with HIV to continue taking Antiretroviral drugs ((ARVs) so that they can live a healthily. She gave the advise when addressing members of the Tanzanian People Living with HIV Network (Nacopha) in Kilombero District Council, Morogoro Region during her tour in the area to review the implementation of their duties. “I commend you for your courage to come out and show the world that this challenge is for all of us; I urge you to continue using antiretroviral drugs," she remarked. A report released by Tanzania Commission for AIDs (TACAIDS) last year, indicates 52 per cent of Tanzanians infected by HIV know their status, of which 55.9 are female and 45.1 per cent, male. It said that 90.9 of all people diagnosed with HIV infection had already received sustained ARVs and 87.7 per cent of those receiving ARV therapy had viral suppression. The Executive Director of TACAIDS, Dr Jerome Kamwela, explained that the prevalence rate of new HIV infections is 4.7 per cent. “The government is committed to ensuring that all HIV/AIDS survivors are serviced and provided for their basic needs, including access to ARVs and to ensure that a larger group of women who are the most affected are reached as far as possible and will continue to support the group reduce the risk of getting infected with new infections,” Dr Kamwela further explained. He added that statistics show the prevalence of new infections annually is 72,000 people while the youth group aged 15 to 24 leads by 40 per cent and that the group contributes to 80 per cent of the cases. Nacopha Chairperson for the district, Halida Ally, explained that the shy away behaviour to take ARVs has contributed to the rise of new infections where they successfully encouraged 30,712 people to test. She said a total of 2,038 people were infected of whom 1,327 are women and 711 are men.
