WORKERS of the Tanzania Electric Supply Company (Tanesco) were cheered by villagers and students as they dropped electricity poles in a surveyed area to Christon Boys Secondary School on the outskirts of Kisarawe Town. Shouts of joy were heard as the poles were offloaded from Tanesco trucks. “Power is coming, power is coming. This time Tanesco is serious,” ran some of the chants. The poles were ferried to the surveyed area to heed a directive given to Tanesco by Deputy Minister for Energy Subira Mgalu when he visited the school two months ago. The minister called on Tanesco to connect the school to the national grid to save the school from unnecessary costs incurred by using diesel generators. “This is President Magufuli era. Power is reaching the homes of the poor and the rich. Electricity to us was a distant dream,” said Mr Idi Shabani, a villager who witnessed the offloading of electricity poles, adding that residents were thankful to Ms Mgalu for giving the directive because they too needed to get electricity. He said electricity would open up the area to investors in agro-industries in the area and increase business opportunities. The school headmaster, Mr August Minja, was away and could not comment on the welcome development. However, a Tanesco official on the scene said Tanesco was keen on implementing the deputy minister’s directive by connecting the school to the national grid and supplying power to eligible new customers in the area where the school was situated. The school has a record of good academic performance at national level and is considered to be one of the best schools in Kisarawe District. Power has been a chronic problem in implementation of the school’s extracurricular projects.
