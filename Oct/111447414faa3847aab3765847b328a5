THE number of days for issuance of the environmental impact assessment certificates (EIAs), by the National Environment Management Council (NEMC), has dropped to 95 from 148, the initiative that has contributed to improve investment atmosphere in the country. Deputy Minister of State in the Vice-President’s Office (Union and Environment), Mussa Sima said here recently, “The council is under our ministry. We have our eyes and ears on this issue. Presently, NEMC cannot be accused of delaying to issue EIA certificates. If there is a delay, then it is because of consultants employed by the project that applied for the certificate; not NEMC,” Further, he explain, there have been talks between the two sides ensure no problems arise on the issue. “They (NEMC) are fighting hard to make the investment environment very friendly to investors in order to attract more investment in the country,” he said. The deputy minister said the government has slashed levies in a deliberate effort to motivate investors, giving as example, reduced fuel filling station levy. Previously, he explained, owners used to pay “up to 10m/-, but because of the adjustments made they will pay 4m/-.” He said when one talks about environment, in essence one talks about the survival of the people. “So our job in the ministry is to promote the welfare of Tanzanians without harming the environment.” He called on environment inspectors to submit their work schedules to offices of regional commissioners, explaining that the importance of the inspectors was felt when enforcing the ban on plastic bags. The ministry and NEMC, he said, were doing their best to make a big and positive contribution towards making Tanzania a middle-income industrial nation by 2020.
