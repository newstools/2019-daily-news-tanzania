AT least 157 children have been victims of sexual violence in Moshi Municipal Council in Kilimanjaro Region. This was revealed by Tanzania Association of Social Workers (Taswo) Secretary, Furaha Domitoris during a symposium of social welfare experts and the annual general meeting of Taswo. Ms Domitoris said from January to September this year the children had reportedly been subjected to violence and 52 out of 157 children had been sexually abused, equivalent to 33 per cent. “We have observed that most incidents are not reported to social welfare offices especially in rural areas,” she said. At the symposium, six schools of Moshi Municipal Council have been trained on how to detect violence against children. At least more than 2,000 students have been trained on how to identify and emotional support to victims. Violence against children includes all forms of violence against people under 18 years old, whether perpetrated by parents or other caregivers, peers, romantic partners or strangers. Some parents said acts of sexual violence were caused by some parents not being around when the children were being abused. Chemchem Primary School teacher, Emmy Shughuru said the problem of sexual violence remained high due to the fact that the culprits were not held accountable and many cases did not reach courts of law. Moshi Municipal Social welfare Officer, Duncan Mgati said they had established a onestop centre at Mawenzi Referral Hospital to attend to children who had been sexually abused. Globally, it is estimated that up to 1 billion children aged 2-17 years have experienced physical, sexual or emotional violence or neglect in the past year.
