They appeared before trial magistrate Mr. Geni Dudu yesterday for the second time since they were arrested, but they were not allowed to enter plea to the charges because they fall under the Economic and Organized crime. Other charges include conspiracy to commit an offence contrary to section 384 of the penal Code (Cap 16 RE 2002) as they unlawfully damaged a water pumping station and its equipment at the small town of Laela, valued at 172,000,000/-, being a property of Sumbawanga District Council . The trial magistrate adjourned the case until November 02, this year as investigation over the case is not yet complete.

Both Alex and his co – accused, Stanley were arrested in less than twenty four hours.
