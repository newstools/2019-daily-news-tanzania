AT least 500 small shop owners are set for training on modern trading practices and professional skills that would enable them to improve their businesses. To bridge the gap, TechnoServe Tanzania, a non-governmental organisation, plans offer training to small shop owners and unemployed youth in Dar es Salaam as part of its plan to build competitive businesses, as well as tackling unemployment. The training under the Pan-African Youth Entrepreneur Empowerment Programme (PAYED), funded by Citi Foundation has a gender-focused policy to ensure that 50 per cent of its beneficiaries, in whatever area intervention are women. Technoserve Country Manager, Mr George Kaishozi said it takes drive, resilience and entrepreneurial spirit to be a small independent retailer– qualities that are hugely valuable. “Small shops help to form the economic backbone of many communities. If retail shops can become more profitable and grow, they will generate more employment in communities where jobs are scarce, and broaden the range of products and services available in communities where large retailers don’t operate,” he noted.
