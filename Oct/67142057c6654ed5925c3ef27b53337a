THE Benjamin Mkapa Hospital (BMH) has received three new vehicles worth 335.145m/- aimed at boosting the provision of health services, including the implementation of its medical outreach programme in the rural areas of Dodoma Region. The hospital implements the medical outreach programme in Dodoma rural communities to reach more people in line with the CCM Election Manifesto of 2015. BMH Executive Director, Dr Alphonce Chandika, said at the weekend that the new vehicles would facilitate the hospital’s blood donation programme which kicks off after the construction of its blood bank early next year. “The vehicles will facilitate the implementation of the hospital’s blood donation programme for our blood bank,” said the hospital executive director when he was receiving the vehicles at the hospital. Dr Chandika said the vehicles would enable the BMH to go to schools and institutions with a view to mobilising members of the public to donate more blood that would be stored in the hospital’s blood bank, saying it would address a blood shortage in the Central Zone. “There is growing demand for blood transfusion in the Central Zone due to a growing population in Dodoma and the general hospital’s blood bank cannot cope with demand. Our blood bank will thus help address the shortage,” he observed. The blood bank at the BMH, which is in final stages of construction, will play a key role in bone marrow transplant service commencing next year at the hospital. Bone marrow transplant is a medical procedure performed to replace bone marrow that has been damaged or destroyed by disease, infection or chemotherapy. Dr Chandika expressed gratitude to the government for enabling the BMH to get the vehicles, urging the hospital staff to take care of the vehicles so that they could last for a long time.
