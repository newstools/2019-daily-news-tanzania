AT least 14,419 cases of gender-based violence (GBV) experienced by children were reported to the Police Gender Desk in 2018 which is an increase of 1,034 cases from 13,457 cases reported in 2017. Speaking in Dodoma yesterday, Minister for Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children Ummy Mwalimu the increase was equivalent to 7.7 per cent. “According to Police Force, last year there were 14,419 violence cases against children reported to the police,” she said while delivering her opening speech at a social welfare officers’ symposium. The symposium, which was organised by the Community Development Association of Tanzania (Codepata), brought together social welfare officers from across the country to discuss issues pertaining to their profession. Ms Mwalimu noted that there were some initiatives carried out by the government, in conjunction with key stakeholders, to encourage members of the public to report to security organs whenever they experienced or suspected GBV.
