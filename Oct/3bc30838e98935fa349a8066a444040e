ASSOCIATION of Tanzania Employers (ATE) has introduced a system of providing important information on labour laws and occupational safety and health to educate employers about the laws and avoid frequent conflicts and maintain occupational safety and health. ATE Director, Dr Aggrey Mlimuka, told reporters in Dar es Salaam yesterday that the system would help build and maintain good relationship among workers in the workplace, increase productivity and promote the national economy. “We join other companies, institutions and organisations to mark International Customer Service Week by introducing a new system that will inform our members about labour laws and occupational safety and health.The information provided for each week will also help members know what exactly ATE is doing and get feedback on our services,” Dr Mlimuka said. He pointed out that ATE had also provided to its members with an opportunity to propose what could be done to improve ATE services and continue being the voice of employers in the country. “We also enable our customers to give us feedback on what we are doing,” he said. He added that ATE was committed to ensuring its members improved communication with a view to maintaining friendly relations. He further noted that ATE members continued growing and currently had over 1,400 registered direct members and over 6,000 indirect members drawn from private business firms, companies and some parastatal organisations whereby the majority of members were based in Dar es Salaam and other parts of Mainland Tanzania. He said through its own initiatives and with support from development partners ATE had strengthened its capacity to represent and serve member companies and continued improving its competitiveness and human resources. ATE is in the third year of implementing its business plan 2015-2017 towards achieving the goals stipulated in the 10-year corporate plan 2015- 2025.
