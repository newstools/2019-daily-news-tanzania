AS tourism grows by leaps and bound in Africa, becoming a key growth driver, Tanzania is East African Community’s (EAC) top destination, beating other member states in revenue earnings. Travel and tourism in Africa grew by 5.6 per cent in 2018 compared to the global average of 3.9 per cent and the broader African economic growth rate of 3.2 per cent, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC). This makes Africa the secondfastest growing tourism region after Asia-Pacific. Some 67 million tourists visited Africa in 2018, representing a rise of seven per cent from the previous year, as African countries reap the benefits from positive policy changes coupled with increased investments that have made the sector more attractive. Tanzania earned 2.43 billion US dollars from tourism in 2018 from 1.49 million tourists who visited the country, according to official data. Kenya generated 1.55 billion dollars last year from over 2 million last year tourist arrivals, according to the ministry of tourism. Uganda made 1.4 billion dollars in 2018 after receiving 1.8 million tourists and Rwanda Tourism earnings were estimated at 438 million dollars in 2017 up from 390 million dollars in 2016 and 368 million US dollars 2015, according to the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) and the National Bank of Rwanda. However, the EAC countries are far behind Ethiopia which stands out not only as Africa’s fastest growing travel economy but indeed the world’s. Tourism in the country grew 48.6 per cent last year and is worth 7.4 billion US dollars. The WTTC also found that travel and tourism spending made up 61 per cent of the country’s exports. This stunning growth can be attributed, in part, to Ethiopia’s improved connectivity as a regional transport hub and to recent visa relaxation policies. Full story in Business Standard pull-out.
