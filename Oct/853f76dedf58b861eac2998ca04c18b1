MEMBERS of Parliament (MPs) meet in Dodoma today to deliberate, among other things, on proposals for the roadmap of the final national development plan and state budget before the general election next year. According to a statement issued by the National Assembly, there will be committee meetings to review proposed parameters of the national development plan and the budget for the fiscal year 2020/21. This is the fifth proposal that MPs will see and discuss since November 2015. This process stands as a testing phase for parliamentarians to ensure the development plan and budget that they may endorse correspond to the interests of their voters. The fifth phase government under President John Magufuli will also run for the second term in office. However, observers say the government has made great strides in service delivery especially access to water, education, electricity, health and roads. “There will be 14 committees meeting in Dodoma from October 21 to November 1,” part of the statement reads. They will evaluate a Treasury register statement on public capital investments in various organisations and institutions in the country. The committees will also scrutinise various reports by the Controller and Auditor General (CAG) on local and central governments for the fiscal year ending June 2018. The statement says further that there will also be a review of government performance of ministries and various institutions as well as an assessment of numerous subsidiary pieces of legislation tabled during the 16th Parliamentary sitting.
