A TEAM of Chinese investors from Hebei province has shown readiness to investment more in Coast Region after the release of the region's investment guideline. The Regional Commissioner (RC), Eng. Evarist Ndikilo, yesterday gave the guideline to the team of five Chinese investors from the province who visited the ongoing industrial exhibition in the region. Eng Ndikilo said the Hebei County is highly developed and has many high-tech industries, and would thus be beneficial to Tanzania if they would transfer that technology to Coast Region. "We have given them the investment guideline and they have been pleased so much, and shown readiness to come and invest here," Eng Ndikilo stated. The province is known for processing high technology in producing cement since 1886 and is a major producer of iron globally. Investors from this county have invested in 90 countries in the world, 27 of them in the African continent. In Africa, the investors from the Hebei have a total of 127 projects. Eng Ndikilo said the team would go through the investment guideline and would soon give their position on which area they prefer to invest in. Apart from vast opportunities for investment in the region, Eng Ndikilo assured them of a conducive good investment environment and the country's stable political situation. "Tanzania, being politically stable and the prevailing peace, their capital will be safe," he said. The region also assured the investors of a reliable market for the industrial products, considering that the region is near Dar es Salaam Region which has a big population.
