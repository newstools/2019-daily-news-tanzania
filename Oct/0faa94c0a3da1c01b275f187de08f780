DEPUTY Minister for Education, Science and Technology, Dr William Ole Nasha, has said cheating at exams in secondary education has dramatically dropped from 3,303 in 2012 to 252 cases last year, while in primary education has dropped from 9,736 in 2012 to 357 cases last year. He said in the past some dishonest National Council for Technical Education (Nacte) staff members were involved in cheating, but then things changed, thanks to the government’s improved inspection initiatives. Speaking in Dar es Salaam yesterday, Dr Ole Nasha said special marks ingrained in certificates would help anyone check whether a certificate was valid or fake. He stressed that they would continue cracking down on cheating at all levels and make sure always people used in exam cheating were known. He stressed that what had happened in some schools of Dar es Salaam, Mwanza and Chemba, would not be repeated. He was speaking at a meeting with National Examinations Council of Tanzania (Necta) staff. He warned that those engaged in exam cheating should know that it was economic sabotage. Necta Executive Secretary, Dr Charles Msonde, too said exam cheating cases had decreased since 2012 after they had cancelled the results of 9,736 candidates who dubiously passed the Standard Seven exams. “Last year we cancelled the results of 357 candidates.” He also said in 2012 they had cancelled the results of 3,303 secondary school candidates and last year the number had dropped to 252 cases. Dr Msonde explained that using information and communication technology (ICT) had simplified the enrollment of primary school pupils. “An analysis of 531,014 certificates was submitted to Necta for verification. Certification has improved since we have been using special identification marks so much so that one can easily verify one’s certificate using a cell phone or computer.”
