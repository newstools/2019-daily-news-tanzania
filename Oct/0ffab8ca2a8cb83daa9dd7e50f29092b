UBA Tanzania marked Customer Service Week in recognition of the crucial role played by its customer services officers in ensuring the highest standards of excellence and customer happiness across the bank. The financial institution celebrated the event which ran from October 7 through 11, with a major focus to strengthen the available digital channels to enable seamless banking to all their customers. The bank marked the occasion with a number of activities and events. Every day of the week a senior member of UBA Tanzania’s leadership team took on the role of a customer service officer at the bank branches, serving customers alongside fellow employees at the main branch, Pugu. The participating executives included the company’s MD/CEO Usman Isiaka, Chief Finance Officer Hussein Chomete, Head of Corporate Banking, wholesale Banking Musa kitambi and Chief Operations Officer, Flavia kiyanga. Usman Isiaka, CEO and Managing Director of UBA Tanzania said, “UBA is happy to celebrate the event with our valued customers and the major focus is on increasing satisfaction on the usage of our digital products and services. In this competitive market if you do not take good care of your customers, your competitors will, so we put customers first and even our business cards identify all of us as customer service officers. Customer service shouldn’t just be a department; it should be the entire company.” This year’s theme is “Making the Magic Together”.
