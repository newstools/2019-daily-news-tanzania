TANZANIA’S decision to pull out of the 2019 Africa Netball Championship has forced organisers to make some changes as the tournament throws off this Friday in Cape Town, South Africa. The last minutes withdraw has plunged the sport further down and frustrate the national wide campaign to rejuvenate it. Initially, Tanzania had confirmed to take place in this year’s edition but they were forced to withdraw due to financial constraints. This, therefore, meant Pool B was only left with three countries that are Uganda, Kenya and Zimbabwe. According to Kawowo. com of Uganda, It is upon this basis that the organisers decided to change the playing format from groups to roundrobin. This also meant a change in the fixtures for the tournament slated to begin yesterday to 24th October. The team with most points at the end of the tournament will, therefore, be crowned champions just like it has been the case in the last two editions held in Kampala and Lusaka. Defending champions Uganda will start their title defence campaign against Zimbabwe in the last game on Friday at Bellville velodrome. In the opening game, hosts South Africa routed Lesotho 116-10 and the former will return in action against Malawi later on. The other fixture to be played on Friday will see Kenya taking on Zambia.
