TANZANIA becomes the second African country after South Africa to use TV white space (TVWS) technologies to improve internet access in rural areas. The University of Dodoma (UDOM) has been assigned to execute the ambitious project. White spaces in telecommunications refer to frequencies allocated to broadcasting services but not used locally. UDOM Information Technology (IT) expert Jabhera Matogoro who is supervising the project, said here that UDOM has undertaken the pilot project in Kondoa District, noting that it has registered great achievements in the district’s rural communities. “UDOM had carried out the project in Kondoa after acquiring a two-year permit from Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) for it,” said the UDOM expert. Mr Matogoro said three institutions in Kondoa have been connected with high speed inter“This number demonstrates that majority of mobile phone users cannot enjoy digital economy due to lack of internet services,” said the expert. Mr Matogoro explained that some 86 per cent of rural residents have no access to internet services compared to 44.6 per cent of mobile phone users in urban areas who don’t access internet service. “The figure indicates that a total of 65 out 100 mobile phone users access the internet services in urban areas,” he said. Mr Matogoro said UDOM conducted a study in Dodoma Urban, Bahi, Chamwino and Kondoa to establish internet service access, saying the study indicated that 18 per cent of white spaces were not used.
