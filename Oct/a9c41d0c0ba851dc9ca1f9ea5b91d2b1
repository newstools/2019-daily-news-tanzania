THE high rate early pregnancies in Rukwa region is worrisome as 29 per cent of teenage and school girls aged between 15 to 19 years have either been impregnated or delivered babies. The gloomy picture was painted by the Director of Practice for Girls & Women Career Development (PGGWOCADE) Foundation Ms Jackline Tung'ombe when addressing a special forum dubbed ‘Her Career’ held here. The forum brought boys and girls from 12 secondary schools from the four districts in Rukwa region. It was organized and coordinated by PGWOCADE Foundation and founded by Plan International Tanzania which is implementing Uzazi Salama project in Rukwa Region. Tung’ombe said school girls are facing various challenges of early pregnancies and a latest study shows Rukwa Region has recorded 29 per cent. "I hope that all of us have responsibility on the girl career dream and we have to find a way to support education for girls,” she said. "We extend gratitude to Uzazi Salama Rukwa Project for supporting this Forum. PGWOCADE recognizes your efforts in reducing maternal mortality and provision of quality friendly sexual reproductive health services," she explained. Girls aged between 16 and 17 years from Kalembe and Chisenga Public Secondary schools in Kalambo District and others from Lukangao Secondary School in Sumbawanga municipality called for the building of school hostels for girls who stay in rented houses. They claimed that one of the big challenges is that street boys allegedly invade their rooms at night with the purpose of raping them.
