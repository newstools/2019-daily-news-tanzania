TANZANIA Telecommunications Company Limited (TTCL) yesterday launched a mobile application for customers to access its services as part of celebrations to mark Customer Service Week. Customer Service Week is an international celebration of the importance of customer service and of the people who serve and support customers on a daily basis. In 1992 the US Congress proclaimed Customer Service Week a nationally recognized event, celebrated annually during the first full week in October. The TTCL Corporation joined the rest of the world to mark the Day, with its Director-General, Waziri Kindamba said the company would use the week to provide their customers with new services. The TTCL marks the week with a theme: ‘The magic of customer services’, for appreciating the support given by the customers as well as recognising the contribution of the company’s customer service providers. The company introduced the mobile application, the TTCL App, which would enable the customers to access services such as checking airtime balance, buying bundles and others. Mr Kindamba said an area of customer services has been one of the company’s priorities in improving the TTCL operations. “We always strive to attentively listen to customers, address their challenges and consider their views,” Mr Kindamba assured. On his part, chairman of the TTCL board of directors, Mohamed Mtonga, explained that this year’s theme is intended to increase more TTCL customers. “With this theme, we can change temporal customer into permanent customer,” he said, noting that the company has put in place plans to increase the number of customers.
