A MKONGEA resident, Mwajuma Lemauna (78), in Kwakoa Ward, Mwanga District-Kilimanjaro Region is fighting for her life at the KCMC Referral Hospital after being attacked by an Elephant. Speaking to the ‘Daily News’ on the incident, Kwakoa Ward Councilor, Mr Rogers Msangi, said she was attacked by the jumbo at her home on Sunday at around 8am. “She was on her daily routine at home, when the elephant attacked her and critically injured her,” further said Mr Msangi, after visiting her at the hospital yesterday. He further said: “During the attack Ms Lemauna broke her left arm and such frequent attacks by the Elephants in the area are now too much. However, we wonder why they most occur on Sundays like a similar incident in August this year, when they injured two men. “We have been victims of the stray elephants recently; they attacked the village and destroyed crops.” However, he urged the relevant authorities to look on ways to handle the situation, because loosing human lives is painful just because of wild animals’ attacks. “People are now fearing to continue with their agricultural activities because once they cultivate crops the elephants will destroy them, and this means that this year’s short rains will go down without being utilized for fear of the animals,” the Councilor added
