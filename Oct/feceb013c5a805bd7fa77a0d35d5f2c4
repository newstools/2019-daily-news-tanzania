THE chance of the Tanzanian envoys, JKT to advance to the next stage of the maiden Basketball Africa League (BAL) hangs in balance as they now have to wait for results of other groups. This comes after JKT finished third in their Group D qualifying round climaxed over the weekend at the National Indoor Stadium in Dar es Salaam. JKT utilized well their home ground advantage to win BAL qualifying Group D opening game with 87-47 over Hawassa of Ethiopia last Wednesday and wound up their campaign with 88-68 victory over Dynamo of Burundi on Sunday. They missed out the two automatic slots after finishing third with 6 points in the five team’s battle that saw Rwandan Patriots finishing at the top with 8 points, while second-placed City Oilers of Uganda bagged 7 points to join Patriots as the qualified team. Though, Tanzania Basketball Federation (TBF) President Phares Magesa said in Dar es Salaam yesterday that is not yet all over for JKT as they have some hopes in store to progress in ‘wild card’ decision. “We are happy that the tournament went well, two top teams booked slots for the second round, third-placed JKT have also a chance to progress through ‘wild card’ which will be decided from other group results."
