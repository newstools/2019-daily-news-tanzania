OVER 500,000 food granaries will be available in the country before year end in efforts to implement the newly launched National Post- Harvest Management Strategy. Vice-President Samia Suluhu Hassan launched the strategy during this year’s NaneNane exhibitions in Simiyu region, describing it as a bold move to address post- harvest losses of major crops in the country. The 500,001 food granaries were exposed in Dar es Salaam yesterday by Deputy Minister for Agriculture Omary Mgumba during the stakeholders’ meeting to discuss the strategy execution. He said findings show that cere- al-related crops’ loss is between 30 and 40 per cent while horticultural products’ loss is over 50 per cent. “The government has decided to come up with this strategy, which plays multiple roles in terms of improving farmers’ livelihoods, eradicating poverty as well as con- tributing to the national economic growth,” he said. The deputy minister added that the strategy implementation will also involve intensification of public awareness campaigns to en- lighten farmers on the negatives of post-harvest loss and possible miti- gations. He said food security is one of the ministry’s prime goals in en- couraging economic growth and promoting industrialisation. Mr Mgumba stressed that food scarcity is one of the global chal- lenges, with findings showing that there will be nine billion people by 2050, with their food demand esti- mated at 60 per cent over the cur- rent need. Agricultural Non-State Actors Forum (ANSAF) Executive Direc- tor Audax Rukonge said for best ex- ecution of the strategy, the govern- ment should set priorities, including the mobilisation of financial insti- tutions to have been offering soft loans to investors in the agriculture sector. The move will serve in among others, encouraging many people to invest in farm crops processing in- dustries, which is one of the steps to curb post-harvest loss.
