THE Permanent Secretary (PS) in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation, Dr Faraji Mnyepe, has said the country is set to benefit more from China-Tanzania bilateral relationship as it was going deeper down to people relationship through culture exchange of the two countries. Dr Mnyepe, who was speaking during the launch of International Photo Gallery Exhibition, the historical path China went through in its development endeavours in Dar es Salaam yesterday, said: “This reminds us to exchange cultures and learn from the people of the Republic of China to work hard for our county’s development.” Chinese Ambassador to Tanzania Wang Ke said the International Photo Gallery Exhibition, which included 150 photos’ display, was part of the commemoration of the 70th anniversary since the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949 when the country’s culture was revisited. “China actively advocates building a community with a shared future for humankind. The core concept of this community is that in the face of numerous global issues and challenges, we maintain peace instead of war, development instead of poverty, cooperation instead of confrontation and a winwin situation instead of the zero-sum game,” she said. The envoy added that China-Africa enjoyed traditional friendship. “Over the past half century, China and Africa (Tanzania included) have been sharing weal and woe and have formed a community with common destiny.” For his part, the chairman of the governing board of Fair Competition Commission (FCC), Prof Humphrey Moshi, said China’s current government was embracing a culture which was more people-centred aiming at emulating good deeds which were vital for development. “President John Magufuli has been embracing the culture promoted by Mwalimu Julius Nyerere and the Father of China Mao Zedong in punishing underperformance, laziness, corruption and unethical conduct among public servants,” he said.
