THE Chief of National Service, JKT, Brigadier General Charles Mbuge, has affirmed that the training conducted by the army for the youth is not meant for offering them employment but rather provide skills for them to build economic independence for their welfare. General Mbuge made the remarks yesterday and directed top officers of armed forces to clearly clarify to youth that employment was not part of training but was strictly meant for developing the nation by providing them with skills. “JKT is not a place for securing employment; it is a place meant for imparting skills that would be useful for the youth upon completion of training,” he said. Brigadier General Mbuge was speaking during a meeting with top officials of the institutions, departments and schools under the national service. It was his first encounter with them after being promoted to Brigadier General. He decried the notion some youth nursed, that they would secure employment immediately after training, which prompted some of them to engage in misdeeds when their expectations are not met. The brigadier general said that some of youth had been expelled from training camps over misconduct. He revealed that some of them had gone as far as communicating directly with top officials seeking employment, a trend he termed as gross misconduct. He also warned national service officials who cooperated with the misbehaved youth by giving them hopes of employment. He reminded the officials to stick to the main purposes of national service training, including developing cultural and sociological awareness, training and developing youth for national services and assisting the government, build and develop the national economy and provide skills, and build economic independence to reduce unemployment. In another development, General Mbuge directed the officials to set up strategies that will see the national service by feeding itself and for the youth to reduce dependency on the government.
