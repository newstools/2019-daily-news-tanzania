TANZANIA Volleyball Association(TAVA) has been urged to start a grassroots level development programme in schools to enable the sport to regain its lost glory. The call was made yesterday here by Arusha Sports officer Benson Maneno during the official opening of international volleyball competition to honour Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, the founding father of the nation who passed away on October 14th , 1999. Maneno said volleyball has lost popularity in the country because it has not been well promoted and said the only solution is to start its effective development at school levels. He said TAVA must find appropriate means to enable people or sports stakeholders to invest in schools where a young player uses sports as part of his or her daily life. In retrospect, the Chairman of TAVA Major General(rtd) Patrick Mlowezi said they decided to move Nyerere Cup Volleyball tournament to Arusha due to a good support they have been offered by regional government officials including the regional commissioner, Mrisho Gambo. Teams from Rwanda, Burundi, Malawi, Zambia and Mozambique are taking part in this yearâ€™s tournament, according to the organisers. He, however, said teams from Democratic Republic of Congo have not arrived in Arusha despite giving confirmation they were on their way to the city. The President of Zone Five Volleyball Association, Gusteve Nkurunzinza said the regional tournament is very essential in developing the sport.
