KAGERA Regional Commissioner (RC), Brig Gen Marco Gaguti, has warned workers in various health facilities to ensure that elderly people are given priority. He also directed councils in Bukoba, Muleba, Biharamulo, Ngara, Karagwe, Kyerwa and Missenyi to provide health service identity cards to elderly people to enable them get free medical treatment. Mr Gaguti made the remarks during celebrations to mark the International Elderly Day held at Izigo Ward in Muleba District on Wednesday. "I have received complaints from some senior citizens, who lamented that they are often being mistreated when they seek treatment at hospitals and dispensaries and did not get essential drugs for some of the diseases which affect them, including prostate cancer, diabetes and heart-related diseases," he said. Muleba District Commissioner (DC), Engineer Richard Ruyango, on behalf of the RC, noted that the fifth phase government under President John Magufuli has shown its commitment to health, largely through fund allocation. The budget for buying drugs was increased from 31bn/- during the 2015/16 financial year to 270bn/-during 2017/18 and there was no shortage of drugs. The elders appealed to the government to speed up payment of monthly pensions to enable them spend their remaining years happily.
