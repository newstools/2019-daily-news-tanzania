MINISTER of State in the President’s Office (Regional Administration and Local Government) Selemani Jafo has emphasised the importance of cooperation between district administrative secretaries (DASs) and executives. The minister, speaking during a recent meeting with newly appointed DASs, pointed out that the latter should avoid a trap their predecessors fell into due to lack of cooperation. “The government’s main agenda is revenue collection and good management of development projects and public funds. The DASs failed to deliver due to lack of cooperation,” said the minister, while opening the meeting. Earlier, Deputy Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of State in the President’s Office (Regional Administration and Local Government) Mathias Kabunduguru said the DASs should be aware of the upcoming local government elections. “The RASs should as well supervise voter registration for the upcoming local government elections. Most of the new DASs are familiar with local government responsibilities because they were executives in the same portfolio,” he said. Mr Mohamed Mavura, one of the newly appointed DASs, said he was going to Lindi Region while he was aware of ongoing public projects and the upcoming local government elections. “I promise to cooperate with my executives to ensure local government elections become successful,” said Lindi DAS. District administrative secretaries, who took oath of office before officer in charge of Ethics Secretariat Ndaki Muhuli are Siha District Administrative Secretary Rehema Bwasi, Morogoro District Administrative Secretary, Sheillah Lukuba and Kyela District Administrative Secretary Diana Zachariah. Others are Butiama District Administrative Secretary Hanji Godigodi, Mbozi District Administrative Secretary Saidi Magari, Uyui Administrative Secretary Hawa Mposi and Malinyi District Administrative Secretary Godwin Chacha.
