UNFANCIED Machomane fought brilliantly to hold giants Polisi Zanzibar to a barren draw in the Isles Premier League match staged at Gombani Stadium in Pemba. Both teams played good football and created a numerous of scoring chances, but unfortunately none of them resulted into a goal. Poor finishing was a big problem in the both sides and if were all converted the game could finish with a big number of goals. Until this week Zimamoto are on the top of the Zanzibar League table with 12 points and they are closely followed by KMKM who have stamped 10 points. The Isles league is played in four days of the week starting from Friday to Monday. KMKM who are defending champions have been forced to play extra hard to catch Zimamoto upfront. Zimamoto, who narrowly missed the championship look well organised this season, but they have to clear KMKM, Malindi, JKU, and Mlandege hurdles to win the championship this season.
