IT was a black weekend for Polisi Zanzibar at Amaan Stadium here when they found themselves conceding five unanswered goals from Zimamoto. It was the second five-goal drubbing for Polisi Tanzania, who last week lost to Mlandege at the same venue. The victory has earned Zimamoto 16 points to tie with KMKM who have also hauled 16 points after playing six matches. Like KMKM, Zimamoto have played six matches, won five and drew once. Superior goal average has put Zimamoto at the top, hence demoting KMKM to the second place. Zimamoto opened their goal account in the 17th minute through Juma Ally Yusuf before Yusuf Ramadhan adding the second in the 39th minute. Zimamoto netted their third goal a few seconds before the breather through Ibrahim Hamadi Hilika. The third goal for the leaders came just eight minutes after breather and it was Yusuf Ramadhani again who made it. Kheri Mtwana netted the fifth goal in the 72nd minute through a spotkick. At Mao Tse Tung stadium here, Mafunzo and Kipanga fought to a 1-1 draw in closely fought match. At Gombani Stadium in Pemba, JKU punished Machomane 3-0 in a one-sided game.
