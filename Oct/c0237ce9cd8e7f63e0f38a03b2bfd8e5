DEPUTY Minister for Agriculture, Natural Resources, Livestock and Fisheries, Dr Makame Ali Ussi, yesterday informed the House that shortage of ploughing tractors is to blame for continued complaints from farmers over delays in having their farm land ploughed. He said there are few tractors with ploughing machines, leading to delays to provide services to farmers in time due to long rotation, “We intend to purchase more tractors, at least one hundred. We want farmers to use modern technology in farming,” he said. Dr Ussi said this when he was responding to questions from backbenchers led by Mr Ali Suleiman Ali (Kijitoupele), who wanted to know why farmers continue to complain over delays in having their land ploughed or tilled in time, which affects their farming timetable. Because of inability to own modern farming equipment, farmers still rely heavily on the government to provide tractors for land ploughing in preparation for farming season. Each farmer pays a subsidized amount of 30,000/-for ploughing. Zanzibar farmers still produce less than 40 percent of the food for home consumption, but through ongoing strategies which include provision of farm inputs on subsidized price and irrigation with support from development partners (mainly Korea, Indonesia, and China), the country anticipates to double production, particularly in rice by 2023.
