THE government plans to introduce beekeeping training and extension guidelines which will enlighten beekeepers and stakeholders on their responsibilities. Speaking during a beekeeping stakeholders’ meeting recently, Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism Director of Forest and Beekeeping, Dr Ezekiel Mwakalukwa, said the government had formed a 10-member team to develop the programme. " I appeal to beekeeping stakeholders to cooperate with the team when it starts to collect views on the programme," he said. Dr Mwakalukwa noted that the programme would improve honey production in the country. According to Dr Mwakalukwa, the country has the potential for beekeeping due to the presence of both natural and established forests. " Tanzania is endowed with 48.1 million hectares of forest reserves which is equivalent to 54.4 per cent of all the country's land," he explained. He said that while some forests were protected areas (38 per cent), other forests (57 per cent) were not. “Six per cent of the forests are in national parks, game reserves and game controlled areas.” He pointed out that the government through Tanzania Forest Services Agency (TFS) had set up 11 beekeeping reserves in various parts of the country and local government authorities had set 14 beekeeping reserves in villages.
