TANZANIA Taekwondo Federation has elected a team of officers to lead the martial arts organization in the next four years, until 2023. From the ballot box, it was Ramoudh Ally, who emerged the new Tanzanian Taekwondo Federation (TTF) President, while Joseph Chuwa becomes the federation’s Vice- President. During the voting exercise, Shija Shija was elected the Secretary General of TTF, while Frank Msowoya was elected the Director of Martial Arts events and Taekwondo Competitions. The Taekwondo Federation, which was founded here over 20 years ago and whose activities are mostly based in Arusha, also elected its Technical Director in the person of Richard Kitolo, the new Treasurer Leopold Monge and two committee representatives; Rehema Mohamed and Noah Sajenti. The Taekwondo federation’s elections were supervised by the Sports Development Officer from the National Sports Council (BMT) Millinde Mahona, who directed the new office holders to ensure that they review and amend the current TTF constitution so as to iron out a number of shortcomings. “You need to organize an official Annual General Meeting of TTF where members are to go through each section of the constitution and adjust the same segments as they deem necessary,” stated Mahona. The National Sports Officer insisted that the new Taekwondo officials must work diligently and ensure that all Annual General Meetings take place yearly and timely so that members can be updated on developments. The Arusha City Sports Officer, Benson Maneno appealed to the new office bearers to ensure that Taekwondo with its roots in Arusha, spreads throughout the country as it is an important form of martial arts that will see Tanzania performing better in the forthcoming Olympics. On his part, the TTF Vice-President, Joseph Chuwa, thanked all members for trusting them said in the next four years, the new officials will ensure that Taekwondo gets the respect it deserves as the discipline-oriented martial arts.
