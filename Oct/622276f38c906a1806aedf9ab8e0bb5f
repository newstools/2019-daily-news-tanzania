CONTRARY to claims by doomsayers, statistics show that Mtwara port performed impressively last year, handling more cargo ships and generating more revenues than the previous year. Data released by Mtwara Port Manager Engineer Juma Kijavara indicate that the port handled 141 ships in the 2018/19 fiscal year, raking in 5.645bn/-, an increase of 113 per cent from 66 ships handled in the previous fiscal year. But, despite the rise in number of ships handled, cargo decreased mainly as a result of completion of some mega construction projects in the southern regions, failure to ferry cashew nuts abroad last season and a shift from coal to gas in running Dangote Cement Plant. Data show that in the 2013/14 financial year, the port handled 356,356 metric tonnes of cargo while the following 2014/15 year, handled cargo dropped to 296,577 metric tonnes. In 2015/16, Mtwara port moved 268,035 metric tonne while the following year cargo again rose to 377,590 metric tonnes. Cargo slightly decreased in 2017/18 fiscal year to 363,287 metric tonnes before plummeting further to 106,170 metric tonnes last year. Currently, the port has the 400,000 tonne handling capacity, annually. According to Engineer Kijavara, the decrease in cargo was expected as Dangote Cement plant in Mtwara used to import coal to power the factory ceased the importation and switched to gas and electricity. However, Mr Aliko Dangote remains one of the most reliable users of Mtwara port in ferrying the manufactured cement to Zanzibar, Comoro and some parts of the Southern African countries. On Monday afternoon, reporters toured the port and witnessed 1,000 tonnes of Dangote cement being loaded onto a mega ship to Zanzibar. Acting Mtwara Port Operations Officer Ibrahim Luzuruga, briefed reporters, saying in July 2019, the facility handled 800 tonnes of Dangote cement and 1,000 tonnes in August. Last month 1,000 tonnes of the cement were handled as well. He said Africa’s richest man plans to start ferrying 120,000 tonnes of cement monthly in the near future through Mtwara port but didn’t explicitly state when the plan, which will be executed under concessionary rate agreement, will start. Mr Luzuruga said cashew nuts being a dependable cash crop for the southerners and nation at large, has had substantial contribution to the tonnage handling at the facility. “As you might be aware last season cashew nuts were not exported and this is the factor behind the drop of cargo tonnage handled at the port but this may not be the case this year because as we speak, we have already handled thousands of tonnes of the produce,” he said. He implored other traders in the country with cargo in Dar es Salaam and Mtwara to use the port instead of land transport, which is costly. The cargo ship was on Sunday evening seen loading 22,000 tonnes of cashew nuts that the government purchased last season for export to Vietnam, with reports showing that the consignment was the last. Mtwara Port handles all types of cargo destined for southern regions—Lindi, Mtwara and Ruvuma— as well as some parts of Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia.
