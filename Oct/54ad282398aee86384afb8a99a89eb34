SIMBA SC Head Coach, Patrick Aussems has anticipated a tough game when his team hosts Azam in their fifth Premier League game at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam on October 23rd Speaking after the end of three-matches build up mission, Aussems said he respects Azam as one of the country’s big teams boasting formidable players. He said beating Azam 4-2 in the Community Shield match in Dar es Salaam in August this year, doesn’t guarantee Simba an easy march to another victory. “I have seen Azam since last season and found to be among the football giants in Tanzania. We know them well hence beating them again won’t be easy,” he stressed. Simba whose three-matches build up mission ended with a barren draw with Burundi’s Aigle Noir, managed to beat Bandari of Kenya 1-0 in Dar es Salam before punishing Mashujaa FC of Kigoma 1-0 in their second build up friendly. Commenting on the results, Aussems said he said priority of the mission was to test and drill players not to win by a big margin as it has been for the club most often. “We also wanted to give exercises to the players who have been out of the pitch for a long time due to injuries,” he added. Simba, who are top placed in the Premier League standings, have played four matches and won all of them to command 12 points far above the rest. Azam, who parade 9 points, have won all their three games and are second-placed in the standings.
