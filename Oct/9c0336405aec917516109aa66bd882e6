AS incidents of violence against children and women remain common, members of the public have been reminded that it is important to know about laws regarding offences, particularly the ‘criminal procedure and evidence.’ During a one day workshop on sensitisation and public awareness on laws which back the war against Gender based Violence (GBV) in the country, the facilitator, Mr Mohamed Saleh from the Director of Public Prosecutors (DPP) office said ignorance undermines efforts to protect children and women. He said, “As we fight perpetrators, many escape punishment just because victims and relatives are ignorant about laws. For example, people still shun giving evidence and instead accept settlement out of court and informal compensation, and allow marriage between the victim and perpetrators/ suspects.” Mr Saleh said the criminal and evidence Act has been reviewed and improved, including rape and other sexual offences in the list of non bailable offences, therefore it is important for people to use this opportunity to fight abusers. The Deputy Permanent Secretary (PS), Ms Mwanajuma Majid said at the workshop that it is only through concerted efforts involving everyone at all levels that the war against abuse of children and women can be won. Ms Lulu Mwanakilala from the Legal Services Facility (LSF), which supports several projects here, said that her organisation is committed to sustainability support programmes, including legal aid and improvement of laws to ensure children and women are protected. In his speech at the opening of the workshop held at ZSSF Hall- Kariakoo, the Minister for Labour, Empowerment, Elderly, Women and Children, Ms Maudline Cyrus Castico asked members of the public to spare no efforts in stopping GBV. “We should be accountable and responsible. The war against abuse of children and women needs unity. Report all cases and accept to give evidence when required. You should also use Child-Help-Line of 116 to report any abuse.”
