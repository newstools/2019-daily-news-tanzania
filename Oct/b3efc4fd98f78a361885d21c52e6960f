A total of 75 gender-based violence (GBV) victims have been connected with key service providers in Tarime District, Mara Region. This latest development involves out of schoolgirls who were attending a crucial anti-GBV meeting organised by Children’s Dignity Forum (CDF) recently. CDF is a nongovernment organisation that fights against female genital mutilation (FGM), child marriage and pregnancy in the district. The NGO made it possible for the out of schoolgirls to meet key service providers like judicial officers, gender and children police desks, public prosecutor, social welfare and health personnel. The GBV victims came from several rural areas in the district that had alarming rates of FGM and child marriage. The targeted wards in this campaign are Manga, Nyamwaga, Komaswa, Binagi, Nkende, Pemba, Mbogi, Mwema, Sirari and Susuni. “We are happy that we have linked GBV victims with key service providers and it will be easier for them to be helped,” CDF Programme Officer in Tarime said after the event held at a hotel in Tarime Town. They met Dr Devotha Ernest from Tarime District Hospital who said their hospital had been receiving many children subjected to GBV, including rape. “We help them know that GBV is still a big challenge in Tarime as even the parents of the victims are not ready to cooperate,” Dr Ernest said. Beneficiary girls said CDF’s anti-GBV campaign had helped them to transform their lives. “The education we get from CDF is very beneficial to us. We have saved many girls from undergoing FGM and child marriage. Our lives have also changed for better after engaging in income generating projects,” Ms Happy William, from Magena Village in Binagi Ward, said. CDF Project Officer, Lilian Kimathi explained that they were keen on using girls, including young mothers, to fight against GBV in the district.
