TANZANIA Ports Authority (TPA) is determined to raise revenues to 1tri/- during this financial year, up from 944.7bn/- recorded in the past fiscal year. Hopes were high as the authority surpassed a monthly target for the last August, collecting 91bn/- against the 87bn/- target. “It will be a shame upon us if we will fail to collect this amount,” TPA Director General Deusdedit Kakoko stated during his meeting with editors from different media houses. Engineer Kakoko explained that in the past five years the authority’s revenues have been increasing by 7.6 per cent annually. Each year and collected revenues in brackets are 2014/15 (679.3bn/-), 2015/16 (703.7bn/-), 2016/17 (742.2bn/- ), 2017/18 (818.2bn/-) and 2018/19 (944.7bn/-). He attributed an increase to improved performance of the Dar es Salaam Port and looking for better future as several projects are ongoing to upgrade the ports along the Indian Ocean. The Dar es Salaam Maritime Gateway Project (DMGP) which is still ongoing at the Dar es Salaam Port has already started yielding positive results, with completion of construction of new berths, including the Roll-on/roll-off (RORO) berth. The completion of this new berth will make the port have its vehicle offloading capacity raised from 163,000 to 600,000 annually. Eng Kakoko further noted that increasing the revenues would be possible through a current plan of raising the number of cargo from 17.2 million tons recorded in the last financial year. On other hand, the TPA’s contribution to the government’s coffers has also been increasing every year. In 2013/14 the TPA contributed to the government coffers a total of 10bn/-, and the figure has shot up to 141.6bn/- in the last financial year. Eng Kakoko said within a period of three years the TPA gave to the government about 700bn/-. Apart from contributing to the central government’s revenues, the authority has been effectively paying corporate tax and various levies such as skills development levy. At least 40 per cent of customs duties revenues to the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) come from the TPA, Engineer Kakoko added.
