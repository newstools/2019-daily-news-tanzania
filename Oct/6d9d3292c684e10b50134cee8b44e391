FUEL users in the country will have relief this month following the decline of wholesale and retail prices announced by the Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority (EWURA). For the month under reference, retail prices of petrol, diesel and kerosene decreased by 142 per litre which is equivalent to 6.34 per cent, 59 per litre 2.72 percent and 77 per litre 3.59 percent, respectively. Furthermore, the wholesale prices of petrol, diesel and kerosene decreased by 141.34 per cent per litre which is equal to 6.69 percent and 58.78 per cent per litre 2.88 percent and 76.29 per litre 3.80 percent, respectively. The decrease in local prices of petroleum products imported through Dar es Salaam port compared to the publication of last month is mainly attributable to a decrease in the world oil market prices. For the month under review, the prices of petroleum products in the northern regions will continue to be the same as those that were published last month because there was no new consignment of petroleum products received through Tanga port. Similarly, for the month of October, the prices of petroleum products in the southern regions will continue to be the same as those that were published on September because there was no new consignment of petroleum products that was received through Mtwara port last month. Since there is no Kerosene at Mtwara storage terminals, petrol station operators in Mtwara, Lindi and Ruvuma regions are advised to source the product from Dar es Salaam and therefore, the retail prices of Kerosene for those regions is based on the cost of the product received through Dar es Salaam port and bridging cost to the regions
