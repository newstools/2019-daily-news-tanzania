THE Tanzania Private Sectors Foundation (TPSF) is holding a series of high level meetings in the country’s capital to fine-tune the proposed draft for the establishment of National Skills Council (NSC), which among other issues seeks to increase high skilled workforce in the country. The project, according to TPSF Executive Director, Godfrey Simbeye, is funded by the World Bank and the government of Tanzania in a bid to support the fifth phase government’s agenda of transforming the country into a middle income economy. The government is implementing the National Skills Development Strategy (NSDS) 2016/2017- 2025/2026, through Education and Skills for Productive Jobs (ESPJ). Therefore, TPSF in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology is implementing one of the components of ESPJ, according to Mr Simbeye In this project, he added, TPSF was tasked to establish and facilitate the establishment of National Skills Councils (NSCs) and Sector Skills Councils (SSCs), where six key sectors were given the highest priority. “These sectors are agriculture, tourism, ICTs, works, energy and transport, and the major aim of establishing SSSs is to bring together all key stakeholders in the value chain for improving skills in the country, who include policy makers in the government, private sector and higher learning institutions which are charged with the task of how best to improve skills in the country,’’ said Mr Simbeye. Generally, Mr Simbeye added, at the end, TPSF in collaboration with the government was intending to come up with the National Skills Council (NSC), whose chairman is expected to be the Prime Minister of Tanzania, and this body, according to him, will be established by the Act of parliament so that it can be recognised legally. At the meeting which drew together officials from the ministry of works, participants paid tribute to the project, which they said will help the country to have a skilled population. The ministry was represented by acting Permanent Secretary, Zaina Mlawa, who lauded TPSF for the initiative. She equally promised support during the implementation of the project.
