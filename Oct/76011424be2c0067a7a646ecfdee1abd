THE University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM) through Department of Philosophy plans to host a two-day Third Biennial African Philosophy conference to discuss the role of philosophy in development. An Assistant Lecturer in the Department of Philosophy, Mr Jackson Coy, said the conference that will be organised by the College of Humanities, will be attended by the Minister for Industry and Trade, Mr Innocent Bashungwa, as chief guest. The conference will, among things, discuss the contribution of philosophy to the development and mobilization of Africans and Tanzanians in general. â€œThe event is a preliminary step in philosophy to be understood in Tanzania and Africa as we have a great responsibility to nurture and promote philosophy," he said. Mr Coy noted that the department has also taken steps to establish philosophical clubs from primary and secondary schools to build students' critical thinking abilities and to solve their challenges. He explained that philosophy has a motto saying philosophy is life. A Lecturer from the same department, Dr Josephat Muhoza, said the conference will involve separate stakeholders--national leaders, religious leaders, activists as well as philosophers who include Prof Rwekaza Mukandala, Pauline Marie Eboh, Laurenti Magesa and Wole Sonyika. Dr Muhoza said the conference is under the theme 'building Africa's future on African Philosophy'. Moreover, the conference will be held in the new library hall and at the Confucius Institute. Philosophy as a discipline invests in intellectual development and encourages the birth of new ideas and critical analysis. Philosophy as an autonomous department aims to fill the gap that existed in the academic curriculum of the university overall, with syllabi that provide students with skill sets to improve their reasoning ability and critical thinking capacity.
