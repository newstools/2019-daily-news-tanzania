TWO Wheelchair Basketball teams were flagged off yesterday in Dar es Salaam ahead of the Zone V Basketball Championship set to begin tomorrow in Kenyan capital, Nairobi. The teams comprising 12 men and 12 women are engaged in the mission to conquer the zonal competition and fly high the national flag. The tournament climaxes on October 20th. Addressing members of the media during the flag off event, the Sports Development Officer at the National Sports Council (NSC) Milinde Mahona assured the team that they have full blessing of the government during the games. “Always, while on the ground, remember that you are representing the country as such do your best to get tangible results in most of your matches there,” he said. He then called upon other stakeholders to come forward and help in the promotion of sports especially the ones played by special groups insisting that they too have capacity to flourish on the international map. “Be good ambassadors of Tanzania in Kenya since we have good cooperation with them and we are widely known as a peaceful country,” Milinde stressed. On his part, Tanzania Wheelchair Basketball Association Technical Director Azizy Mwaruka said morale in both teams has doubled prior to the upcoming competition. “We promise Tanzanians nothing but victory. Let me specifically thank the Jakaya Kikwete Youth Park for financing almost 70 per cent of the trip,” he said. On his part, Male team captain Mohammed Machela reiterated that basing on the level of preparations they were subjected to, nothing will stop them from getting the tangible results. While in Kenya, Tanzania will have to defeat fellow East African Community (EAC) rivals such as Uganda, Rwanda and hosts Kenya.
