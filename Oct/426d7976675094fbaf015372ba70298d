AT least 120 football teams made up of over 2000 young soccer players, mostly pupils and students are expected to take part in the tenth edition of ‘Chipkizi Cup,’ to be staged late this year. Organised by the Arusha-based, sporting talent recruiting and promotional institution of Future Stars Academy (FSA), the East African Youth Football Tournament, is going to bring to Arusha teams from, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, Burundi and Z anzibar as well as those from Tanzania mainland. To be staged at the Tanganyika Game Trackers (TGT) grounds from the 10th to 15th of December this year, the Chipkizi Cup marks its 10th anniversary in 2019 after its premier in 2009. The Director of Future Stars, Alfred Itaeli stated here that for the last ten years, the Chipkizi Cups tourneys have produced a number of promising youth footballers, including those that have managed to feature in international soccer events outside the country. Chipkizi Cup, the East African Youth Football Championship, is usually a tourney for young and mostly upcoming players aged between 9 and 20 years of age and these usually fall under the pupils and students brackets. Z akayo Mjema, the Arusha Regional Football Association (ARFA) secretary commented about the Chipkizi Cup, saying that this year all national soccer leaders and officials in the country will attend the tourney to see for themselves, how the youth play. He was concerned that it is usually other countries that get to field more teams and most players even though Tanzania is the one that always host these tourneys. According to ARFA officials, from next year, the Tanzania Football Federation will slot the Chipkizi Cup into the TFF calendars so that they may now be recognised as part of official country tourneys. Last year it was Kenyans who sparkled in the 2018 round of Chipkizi Cup, topping the Under-13 category for both male and female teams. Zanzibar managed to top the Under-20 slots.
