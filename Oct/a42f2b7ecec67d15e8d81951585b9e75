The three winners are the first to be announced from the Tigo Coastal zone, while the other nine winners will be selected from the other zones. The Wakala promotion is organized by Tigo’s Mobile Money business unit, Tigo Pesa, to give back to more than 100,000 agents across the country. The promotion, which runs over a course of one month, awards agents who have made the most transactions in their respective zone in the month. Speaking at the cash handover ceremony was the Acting Chief Officer of Tigo Pesa, Angelica Pesha, who said, “Firstly, I would like to acknowledge and commend all our agents for the significant role they play every day in servicing our customers across the country, secondly I would also like to specifically laud the three winners today, who have distinguished themselves amongst thousands of Tigo Pesa agents in their respective regions.” Pesha also revealed that Tigo Pesa offers full-fledged financial services and the promotion was one of the several activities created by Tigo Pesa in a bid to drive the financial inclusion agenda while engaging its agents across the country. “As a company, we come up with different initiatives, whereby our agents across the country can engage in. We are proud of our contribution in driving the financial inclusion agenda, through Tigo Pesa, by making it possible for millions of Tanzanians to send and receive money and carry out several financial transactions, thus giving a huge financial boost to the individuals, communities and the country’s economy,” remarked Pesha. The Tigo Pesa agents were all smiling as they received their cash prizes. The agent from Zanzibar operating under the name of Suleiman Hussein won 3m/-, while Vicky Ibrahim from Temeke won 2m/- and Anna Mosha from Ilala walked away with 1m/-.
