THE Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA) through Mtwara Port is planning to legalise some unofficial ports after identifying 70 of them, operating along the coast in Lindi and Mtwara regions. Speaking to reporters, Mtwara Port Manager, Engineer Juma Kijavara said a survey carried out by TPA through Mtwara port has identified 59 unofficial ports operating along the coast of Lindi region while eleven others have been identified along the coast in Mtwara region. He said during the survey sensitization work was also carried out to the operators and users, specifically on the adverse effects such illegal ports are poised to cause to themselves and the nation at large. He said apart from causing loss of government revenue and trade imbalance among traders brought about by smuggled commodities, unofficial ports are dangerous for the safety of the country as bad elements can smuggle in weapons with which they can carry out heinous crime. As unofficial ports operate under obscurity people and merchandise entering through them are not subjected to any health checks, a practice that may lead to infiltration of deadly diseases such as Ebola. Cognisant with the fact, Engineer Kijavara said, Mtwara port management hassubmitted recommendations to the headquarters in Dar es Salaam for formalising some of unofficial ports. He mentioned some unofficial ports whose recommendations for legalisation have been submitted to TPA as including Mbuyuni/ Somanga, Kilwa Kivinje, Mchinga II, Songosongo and Rushungi along the coast in Lindi region and Mikindani, Kisiwa, Msimbati, Kilambo and Litembe in Mtwara region. Engineer Kijavara said more unofficial ports will continue to be formalised as it will be determined by the Authority, calling for concerted efforts to sensitise the general public on the effects of using such unofficial entry points in water bodies.
