THE Head of Security and Investigative Unit of Post Office in Dar es Salaam George Mwamgabe (44) appeared before the Kisutu Resident Magistrates’ Court yesterday charged with two counts of trafficking in narcotic drugs. Mwamgabe, a resident of Chang’ombe Maduka, was charged alongside a driver, Abrahamani Msimu (54), who resides at Yombo Makangarawe. The duo pleaded not guilty to the charges before Senior Resident Magistrate, Augustina Mbando. The magistrate granted them bail on conditions of securing two reliable sureties. One of the sureties, according to the magistrate, must be a government employee.
