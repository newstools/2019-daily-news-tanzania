Scheduled for Kampala, Uganda this Wednesday, the judicial gathering organized by the African Court on Human and Peoples Rights (AfCHPR) is a biennial event of the African Union (AU) aimed at improving networking amongst judicial officers, exchange of information and best practices and the proper administration of justice on the continent. Themed Tackling Contemporary Human Rights Issues: The Role of the Judiciary in Africa, the dialogue will be preceded by a first meeting of the International Human Rights Forum. It will also serve as a build-up to the themes of the other three editions held in 2013, 2015 and 2017. “The past three meetings have reaffirmed the importance of the Dialogue as a platform for African national judiciaries to discuss opportunities and continuing challenges relating to their functions,” said Justice Sylvain Oré, AfCHPR President in a statement availed to this paper yesterday. According to Justice Oré, the judicial dialogue is expected to identify the major human rights issues currently facing Africa and what role the Judiciary could play to deal with such issues, among others. The Chairperson of the Uganda National Organising Committee, Ms Esta Nambayo on her, noted that Uganda’s objective of hosting the dialogue was to enhance international judicial cooperation through sharing of Judiciary challenges and best practices among states across Africa and beyond. Other participants in the high profile judicial gathering include representatives of regional and international judicial bodies and other relevant stakeholders, from the 55 AU member states. AfCHPR is a Continental Court established by the Member States of the African Union, to ensure the protection of human and peoples’ rights in Africa.
