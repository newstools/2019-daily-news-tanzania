JAMHURI battled to their first win of the season as they edged out Kipanga 2-1 in a thrilling Zanzibar Premier League encounter played at the Amaan Stadium here on Friday. A stoppage time strike by Mudrik Hamadi ensured Jamhuri walk away with all three points, which saw them leapfrog Kipanga into 10th place in the 16-team log after tallying five points. The losers Kipanga have managed four points so far. KMKM lead the table on 13 points, with Zimamoto in second place with 12 points. Jamhuri, who came into the game on the back of the 5-0 drubbing by Zimamoto, showed a lot of improvement against Kipanga and demonstrated their quest for maximum points from the word go. But they were made to wait for the opener which arrived after 22 minutes through Humoud Abrahman. The goal sparked more attacks from both sides but neither could make a flurry of chances at both ends count and they went for the breather with Jamhuri leading 1-0. The second half was a reminiscent of the opening half with the two sides attacking each at every opportunity and it was Kipanga who succeeded to find the equalizer five minutes after the hour mark. The goal by Mohamed Masoud Dola lifted Kipanga as they pressed hard for winner but lacked incisiveness inside their opponentsâ€™ box. They were made to pay for their lack of killer instinct when Jamhuri grabbed the winner with three minutes of stoppage remaining.
