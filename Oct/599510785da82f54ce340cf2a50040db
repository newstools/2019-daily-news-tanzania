THE Kilimanjaro Regional Commissioner (RC), Ms Anna Mghwira, has expressed her commitment to ensure all road projects implemented by the Tanzania National Roads Agency (Tanroads) and the Tanzania Rural and Urban Roads Agency (Tarura) in the region are of good quality and adhere to the standards. Ms Mghwira was speaking during a meeting held on Thursday that involved officials from Tanroads and Tarura in Moshi, Kilimanjaro Region. “This follow-up is important to us due to the fact that the Government always emphasizes on the importance of implementing road projects well, while at the same time complying with acceptable standards so that the value for money provided to fund the projects could be realized, “ she said. Ms Mghwira expressed her concern following some of the roads, especially those in rural areas, which are not under Tanroads or Tarura being in bad conditions. “During my regular official visits in various areas within the region, especially in rural areas, I have been able to find out that there are some of the community roads which are in a worse condition just because officially they don’t fall under the Tanroads and Tarura service procedures. “Some of these community roads are important economically and to the people living in those areas because they are used by vehicles which go to collect farm produce; due to this factor, respective Local Governments should set aside funds to serve these community roads in their respective areas”, she said. Speaking during the meeting on behalf of the Regional Tanroads Manager, Engineer Nkholante Ntije, Engineer Baraka Mwambage said that a total of 21.255bn/- has been allocated for Tanroads in Kilimanjaro in the financial year 2019/2020 that he said would be used to implement a total of 1,060 kilometres of road maintenance together with 64 bridges within the region. The Kilimanjaro region’s Tarura Coordinator, Mr Meleck Silaa, said Tarura within Kilimanjaro region had been allocated 9.545bn/-, that would be used to finance the maintenance of a total of 966.741 KM of roads in Kilimanjaro Region.
