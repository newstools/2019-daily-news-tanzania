THE Primary Court at Himo, in Moshi district has fined eight residents of the area 100,000/- each or face three months imprisonment after they were found guilty of entering illegally into the land belonging to the Lokolova Co-operative Society based in Himo area, along Moshi-Mombasa road. The eight defendants who were facing two charges; including that of conspiracy to destroy the farm’s infrastructure, included Zakayo Aloyce, Alex Michael, Juma Omar, Heavenlight Msuya, Salimu Mohamed, Abel Peter, Reuben Kinji and Gerald Reuben. In his ruling, the Presiding Magistrate Innocent Nyella said the court found all eight defendants guilty based on the evidence presented in court which proved beyond any doubt that they had illegally entered the Lokolova farm’s area and engaged illegally in agricultural activities as well as construction of buildings despite that fact it was prohibited. “Based on the exhibits provided by the prosecution concerning the prohibition, I would be right if I say that the defendants were aware of the ban but they decided to neglect and entered the area contrary to the complainant’s wishes while at the same time knowing that they had no right to do so,” he said. Regarding the defense’s claim that the farm is in dispute, Magistrate Nyella said that in accordance with exhibit P5 which was submitted by the prosecution, the dispute was resolved by the relevant authorities and that the Lokolova Co-operative Society was legally recognized and that the society was the legitimate owner of the invaded property. As for the second charge against the defendants which regarded the damaging of the Lokolova Co-operative Society’s farm’s infrastructure, Nyella said the court had found out that all the defendants were innocent after the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendants damaged the said properties. All the defendants ‘cheated’ imprisonment after paying the fine, whereby according to Magistrate Nyella, all the defendants had the right to appeal and that the appeal was open to anyone who was dissatisfied with the ruling.
