THE government has unveiled plans to make the Livestock sector contribute up to 20 percent to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2025 from the current 7.9 percent. Making the revelation to media practitioners at the sideline of livestock stakeholders’ conference in Dar es Salaam yesterday, the Ministry for Livestock and Fisheries Development Permanent Secretary (PS), Prof Elisante Ole Gabriel further said that the new strategies would include, bridging knowledge gap between the current generation of Livestock Extension Officers with that of the retired ones. He further said that the approach will educate and guide farmers on better methods on how to improve value chain of their produces. “This will be achieved through prioritizing minimization of the knowledge gap among farmers to improve their methods of grazing, among others. We also want to generate a database of retired livestock professionals as a simple way to locate them so that they can also be engaged as guest speakers in various livestock training institutes, because that is where their experiences and knowledge can be tapped,” noted the PS. He further said that a big number of herders and farmers will raise their animals’ valueless once they listen to professional grazing skills the officers retired with in public. “You (herders and farmers) will reap a lot from the retired Senior Officers and add value of your livestock in terms of health and weight and as well market skin for quality leather and meat,” added Prof Ole Gabriel. He hinted that currently, the country has more than 32 million cows, 20 million goats, more than five million sheep and two million pigs, where chicken account to nearly 80 million producing about four billion eggs annually. The PS also noted that the government plans to ensure that it employs Livestock Extension Officers at all Wards countrywide, who are competent enough to help famers to improve their products’ qualities.
