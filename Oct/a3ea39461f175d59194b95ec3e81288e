SIMBA defeated Singida United 1-0 at Sheikh Amri Abeid Stadium in Arusha to post six-match unbeaten run until yesterday. Miraji Athumani scored the winner in the 41st minute through a powerful strike. It was six straight victory for Simba who continued to command the Premier League helm with 18 points from six-match outings. Meddie Kagere who helped Simba stamp authority in the Mainland Premier League after defeating Azam 1-0 in at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam on Wednesday didnâ€™t score yesterday. Athumani is now second in the race for a golden boot after scoring 4 goals. However, Kagere who has netted 7 goals is far ahead of his pursuers Paul Kikoti of Namungo and Paul Nonga of Lipuli who have netted 3 goals each. But it was not good weekend for Azam who lost 1-0 to Ruvu Shooting at Major General Isamuhyo grounds in Mbweni. It was a second defeat to Azam who last week suffered 1-0 to leaders Simba at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam. Azam have remained with 9 points after playing five matches, winning three and losing two others. Mwadui and JKT fought to a 2-2 draw at Mwadui Complex in Shinyanga. It was a sad day for Lipuli who suffered a 1-0 loss to Coastal Union at Samora Machel Stadium in Iringa. Biashara Mara defeated Namungo 1-0 at Karume Stadium in Mara.
