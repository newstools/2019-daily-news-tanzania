TANZANIAN Selemani Kidunda has revived a medal hope for his country after knocking down Dapura Liyanage from Sri Lanka in the second round of the bout. Kidunda was offensive right from the start punishing his opponent frequently with a combination of hooks and jabs that floored his opponent, but he was quick to beat the countdown. The second round began with a cautious approach, but Kidunda surprised his opponent with lightening jabs that once again put his opponent on the canvas, but again the Sri Lankan managed to stand up before the count reached ten. His comeback was punished again with a powerful left, he couldnâ€™t stand and Kidunda emerged the winner. Speaking after the bout, Kidunda said he had won against the tough opponent who was very tricky. He said his perfect timing and well-aimed punches helped him. Kidunda is among the Tanzanian athletes in the World Military Games in Wuhan, China. But it was not a good day to Alex Isendi who lost to Baatasukh Chinzoring of Mongolia. In China, Tanzanian athletes received a warm welcome from Chinese communities. Most of Chinese friends who could speak some words of Kiswahili said they would be happy if Tanzania wins a medal.
