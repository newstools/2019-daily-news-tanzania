A 1-0 win over Lipuli FC over the weekend earned debutants Namungo FC a second slot in the unfolding Vodacom Premier League (VPL) with 10 points from six matches. The Lindi based side are just two points adrift leaders Simba SC who play on Wednesday against Azam FC at Uhuru Stadium in what will be the major real test for both clubs in the season. A win by Azam will see them tying on points with Simba but the latter will still be on top as they have scored more goals than Azam. Both teams are undefeated so far making the clash exceptional and interesting but the champions look favourites to carry the day. In their last build up match before facing Simba, Azam thrashed First Division League side Transit Camp 3-2 at Azam Complex in a game which the hosts could have easily blown it away after conceding two goals in the second half. On the other hand, Simba were held to a goalless draw by Burundi’s champions, Aigle Noir at Lake Tanganyika Stadium in Kigoma. It was the third win for Namungo in six games who up next face Mtibwa Sugar on Wednesday at Majaliwa Stadium in Lindi hoping to keep the positive start of the campaign intact. Ever since they were promoted, Namungo have been staging good war and are among the most feared league debutants alongside Polisi Tanzania. In other VPL matches played over the weekend, Mbao claimed one point at CCM Kirumba Stadium in Mwanza after a 1-1 draw against Ruvu Shooting while at Sokoine Memorial Stadium in Mbeya, hosts Tanzania Prisons were held to a 1-1 draw by Kagera Sugar. Misery of the campaign continued for Ndanda FC after losing 1-0 to Mtibwa Sugar a situation which led the management of the team to fire its coach Malale Hamsini claiming that his unconvincing trend was hard for them to embrace. “As the club, we are not happy with the trend of unconvincing results and we have seen it necessary to part ways with him as we continue searching for another coach,” said the club’s chairman Paul Walema after the encounter.
