A blast occurred inside an oil tanker MT Ukombozi in Pemba’s Wesha port, sparking a raging fire that left three people seriously injured. The trio, identified as Ali Juma Ame (54), Hafidh Silime Kona (25) and Issa Daudi Omar (30), were cleaning the tanker, which had been unloaded in the early hours of Thursday when the flame erupted in one of the storage chambers. They were airlifted to Mnazi Mmoja Hospital in Unguja, but are still fighting for their lives as they are in a critical condition. Firefighters succeeded to contain the blaze and prevent it spreading in the tanker, which has gross tonnage of 1403 tons. The Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Infrastructure, Communication and Transport, Mustafa Aboud Jumbe, confirmed that there was no massive destruction and commended fire crews for tackling the blaze. “The fire was successful put out but we regret that three of our crews were severely wounded, they are currently being treated at Mnazi Mmoja hospital,” said Mr Jumbe. The MT Ukombozi was the main oil tanker which operated between Zanzibar (Unguja & Pemba) and Mombasa in Kenya. Seeking to increase efficiency in the importation of oil to Zanzibar, the government here recently purchased a new vessel for carrying refined oil. The purchase of the oil tanker, dubbed MT Ukombozi II is likely to lessen frequent shortage of fuel on the Isles. The tanker oil was purchased at Euro 14, 324,000 (about 36bn/=). The 86.21 metres long vessel was received at the port last month.
