THE President of the Automobile Association of Tanzania (AAT) Nizar Jivani has lauded Kenya for regaining the World Rally Championship status saying the comeback is blessing to all East African Community member states. Jivani, one of the East African legends, said bringing WRC in Kenya will also give an opportunity to drivers from Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania to test their skills against World class drivers. “I would like to commend the Kenyan motorsports stakeholders for their tireless efforts,” he said. Two-time national rally championship winner, Dharam Pandya is among those who are delighted to WRC back to East Africa. “The comeback has given us a chance to test our driving skills against World Champions. We can do it as we will be doing it in our own backyard,” said Pandya from Puma Rally team. Most often drivers from Arusha and Kilimanjaro cross borders to compete in rallies of Kenya whenever they are staged in Nairobi or Mombasa. Very likely to support Pandya in his WRC campaign are Gurpal Sandhu, Ajminder Singh, Mandeep Singh, Rajpar Dhani or Guljit Dhani who are based just 100km south of Kenyan border. Safari Rally Kenya regained its World Rally Championship status after inclusion in the 2020 calendar. Kenya, along with Japan and New Zealand make the new rounds of the fourteen 2020 WRC events announced by FIA on Friday.
