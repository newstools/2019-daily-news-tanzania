ZANZIBAR will host the Annual General Meeting of the East African Magistrates and Judges Association, from 21st to 25th of October this year at the Madinati Al Bahri Hotel on the outskirts of Stone Town. Addressing journalists, Zanzibar's Chief Justice (CJ), Omar Othman Makungu said the participants from the EAC countries will discuss and share experiences on 'land and environment' as the theme. "We are expecting between 350 and 400 participants from Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, South Sudan, Tanzania Mainland and host Zanzibar judiciaries to meet here," said Judge Makungu, adding that President Ali Mohamed Shein is scheduled to officiate the meeting. He said that a member country (Judiciary), hosting the AGM is given a chance to choose the main topic for discussion, "We in Zanzibar chose 'Land and Environment' because they are topical issues in our country and beyond," he explained. Justice Makungu explained that the Zanzibar Judiciary will present a paper on land (land tenure/tribunalin addressing land crisis), while Tanzania Mainland’s presentation will focus on the war against illicit drugs, and other countries will present other topics related to the theme. President Shein will open the meeting on October 22, and that after the meeting, delegates will get a chance to explore Zanzibar, at least the historical sites, spice farms, and other tourism sites. Meanwhile, when asked about the global activists’ call on countries to abolish the death penalty, the Isles CJ said it was still a debatable subject with a few countries having already decided to abolish it. He said: "We have about 18 inmates on death row, but implementation has always been difficult since our independence. It is the President who is supposed to authorise the death penalty, but no government has done so."
