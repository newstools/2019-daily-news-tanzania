POLISI intensified their race to Zanzibar Premier League diadem following their 2-1 win over Jang’ombe Boys in a thrilling match at Amaan Stadium in Zanzibar. The win was a good consolation to Polisi who last week suffered double loss to Mlandege and Zimamoto at the same venue. Under the tutelage of Nassor Salum, Polisi took three minutes to open a goal account through Rajab Ali. The goal woke up Jang’ombe Boys from a deep slumber and began to raid Polisi goal frequently. Their efforts paid off midway through Khalfan Abdallah to make it 1-1 at the end of the first half. It was the seventh match for Jang’ombe Boys Boy’s who are now placed 4th after collecting 10 points. They have won three matches, drew once while losing three matches. Jang’ombe Boys suffered in the 67th when Ali Abdallah scored the winner for Polisi. The win enabled Polisi to collect six points after winning one match, losing three matches and drawing in the remaining three. Until this week, Zimamoto are still commanding the Isles League’s pilot seat with 19 points after playing seven matches. They have won six times and drew once. Also enjoying good run in the league are KMKM, JKU, Malindi and Mlandege.
