DODOMA Environmental Network (Donet)—a nongovernmental organisation (NGO) dealing with sustainable management of environment is implementing a project to help the youth raise their voices and utilise the economic potential for Chamwino District. According to project coordinator Emmanuel James, so far there are 60 direct beneficiaries of the project which targets about 200 young people. The eight-month project is implemented in six villages of Chamwino District in the four wards of Msanga, Chinolwa, Dabalo and Membe. Funded by Foundation for Civil Society (FCS), the project targets the youth who are in groups to make them increase public awareness and the morale to realise their economic ambitions. Recently, Donet convened various stakeholders to make presentations to youth groups so that they could utilise economic activities. There were representatives from financial institutions, mobile phone companies, TCCIA, SIDO, as well as representatives from local government authorities (LGAs). Speaking at the forum, Youth Development in Chamwino District Coordinator Sophia Swai said the project, which is expected to reach its climax in March next year, has so far benefited some young people in the district. He said the loans the government had been providing to the youth, women and people with disabilities had helped the youth to transform their lives. “During the last fiscal year, the government provided about 105.1m/- and loan repayment was going on well in the district. One of the beneficiaries of the project, Ms Agnes Messo, said the project had so far helped her to transform her life. “I have learnt a lot from colleagues on how to improve my business,” said Ms Agness, who is an entrepreneur in Chamwino District.
