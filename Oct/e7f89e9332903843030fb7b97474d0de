INSURANCE companies in the country have been urged to come up with special packages which cater for people with low income and turn them to become potential customers. Britam Insurance Company Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mr Raymond Komanga said recently that most insurance companies, despite being operational for many years, are yet to establish friendly means to benefit poor people. "So far, we have not explored market for poor people and it is time we widen up our wings to reach them," Komanga said. He added that Britam Insurance Tanzania is all set to be on the front line to establish various insurance packages that will be enjoyed by low income earners. "We want to operate in the same way banks do, everyone regardless the money he/ she deposits has the opportunity and right to access bank services," he said. He added that his company is currently conducting a study to determine areas with high demand that needs serious and immediate attention.
