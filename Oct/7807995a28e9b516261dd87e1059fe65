PUMA Energy Tanza- nia yesterday contributed 40m/- to assist in the treat- ment of children with heart problems admitted at Ja- kaya Kikwete Cardiac In- stitute (JKCI). Puma Tanzania Manag- ing Director Dominic Dha- nah handled over the dona- tion to Dar es Salaam RC Paul Makonda as the oil marketing firm’s gesture to assist those in need. Mr Dhanah said the donation came following the RC’s campaign to raise funds that will enable the cardiac institute to perform operations. Mr Makonda said the money will be part of the 1.0bn/- raising campaign for operating some 500 children who cannot afford the cost of operations at the cardiac institute. “I will form a commit- tee to oversee that we raise 1.0bn/- for heart related operations for the needy children,” Mr Makonda saidduringtheawardpre- sentation for best primary schools that emerged win- ners in a Road Safety Drawing Competition. The RC wants the Puma chief to be a member of the committee team to be formed. Regarding the compe- tition, the RC said motor- ists should adhere to road safety signs to protect pe- destrians—especially zebra crossings. Mr Makonda was pleased on the way Puma invested in road safety campaigns that reduced children’s accidents since they are tomorrow’s lead- ers.
