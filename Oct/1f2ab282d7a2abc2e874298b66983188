THE downpour that hit various areas of Zanzibar and Pemba forced the cancellation of Premier League matches that were to be staged on Thursday. The lengthy downpour made the league popular sports arenas, including the Amaan Stadium and Mao Dze Dung in Zanzibar and Gombani in Pemba, unplayable. The downpour didnâ€™t affect only football league matches, but also the Karume Cup basketball matches that were to be staged in various courts. Also failed to take place were various Second Division League matches and the district level football leagues in both Unguja and Pemba Islands. At Mao Dze Dung Stadium here, the Second Division League match between West Coast and Shangani was halted in the 73rd minute due to downpour. In Unguja Urban West here, the basketball match between Mwembeladu and Gulioni City and that between Usolo and New West could not take place also due to inclement of weather. Also affected by the downpour was a Second Division League match between Lion Kids and Kisakasaka, which was to be staged at Chukwani ground late evening. Amaan stadium, where Gulioni FC defeated Kundemba 1-0, was the only unaffected venue on that day.
