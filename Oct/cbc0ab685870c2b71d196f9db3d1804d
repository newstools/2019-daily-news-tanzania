EIGHT suspects including two North Mara Gold Mine (NMGM) employees were on Wednesday arraigned at Tarime District Court for allegedly stealing 15 kilograms of gold worth over 230m/-from the company. The suspects were named as Zabron John Seth (43), being CCT camera operator, and James Mahalareri Makune (39), truck operator. The list also includes Jonathan Chuwa Genji (27), Amos Raphael Wahere (28), Mseti Chacha Isaka (32), Chacha Marwa Rhioba (29), Petro Kegora Mariba (32) and Samson Mathayo Mariba (17). They accused were read five different accounts including leading organised crime, unauthorized possession of minerals, stealing, and money laundering as well as criminal trespass into the mine’s premises. However, the criminal trespass did not involve the two mine workers, but were grouped in the other charges. In a related development Minerals Deputy Minister Stanslaus Nyongo has warned that the government would not tolerate gold thefts to continue in any company, saying: “This is a syndicate and we are out to dismantle it. All those stealing gold from the North Mara Gold Mine must stop." Expounding, Mr Nyongo told minerals’ dealers especially those trading on gold that a market has been opened for them in the region, and hence asked them to refrain from illegal trade of the minerals.
