BOARD of Directors of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority (NCAA) on Saturday visited the family of the Father of the Nation, Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, at Butiama in Mara Region. The NCAA board members donated a gift featuring the September 1961 Mwalimu Nyerere’s declaration on the importance of conserving wildlife forever. “Mwalimu was a lover of conservation and his declaration of September 1961 is behind the successes of the conservation we are seeing today,” NCAA Conservation Commissioner, Dr Fred Manongi, said after handing over the gift to the family of Mwalimu. Dr Manongi said the Founding Father of the Nation deserved great honour for conservation. The son of Mwalimu Nyerere, Mr Madaraka Nyerere received the gift. Mr Madaraka said the availability of the declaration to members of the public would boost conservation campaigns in the country. The family will decide where to put the gift, but it is likely to be inside Mwalimu Nyerere Museum which is equipped with rich collections on Mwalimu. “As a family we are very much grateful to NCAA for this declaration and we are ready to continue cooperating with NCAA on conservation matters,” the sixth son of Mwalimu said. Mr Madaraka said doors were open for other key conservation stakeholders to cooperate with the family of Mwalimu in the promotion of the sustainable conservation of wildlife and the environment. After making the donation, the NCAA board of directors also went around Mwalimu Nyerere’s home village to view various attractions, including Mwalimu Nyerere Butiama Museum. Today Tanzanians commemorate the 20th anniversary of the death of Mwalimu Julius Nyerere.
