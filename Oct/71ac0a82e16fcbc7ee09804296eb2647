DODOMA, Tabora and Singida are the country’s top three regions in producing, packaging and exporting hon- ey to over 20 countries in the world, according to the Tan- zania Forest Service Agency (TFS). In an interview with the ‘Daily News’ on the sidelines of the TFS meeting between the management and district managers here, the agency’s Beekeeping Officer, Ms Frida Kundy, said the agency was continuing with its efforts to provide education to people so that the honey produced in the country maintains its highest levels of quality. She mentioned among the countries where the honey produced in Tanzania has the biggest market as Germany, England, Belgium, France and Italy. Others are Norway, Ke- nya, Uganda, Oman, Rwanda, Dubai, Japan, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Iran and United States of America (USA). The beekeeping officer pointed out that, generally, market prospects for honey locally and internationally were superb, adding that cur- rently, the country was in the process of venturing into the Chinese market. Apart from Tabora, Dodoma and Singida regions, Ms Kundy cited other honey producing regions as Mbeya, Rukwa, Katavi, Iringa, Kigo- ma and Shinyanga. She also explained that honeycomb was being pro- duced and was also exported, adding that TFS was intensi- fying its training programmes covering beekeeping stake- holders, hinting that 225 peo- ple from different groups had benefited from the training. “About 95 per cent of bee- keepers are pursuing natural beekeeping while the remain- ing 5 per cent are engaged in modern beekeeping,’’ she added.
