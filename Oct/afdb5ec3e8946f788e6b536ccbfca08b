IN 1974, a visionary Pan-Africanist Julius Kambarage Nyerere, who was determined to achieve peace and unity of Tanzania, said: “If real development is to take place, the people have to be involved…without unity, there is no future for Africa,” with a school of thought that sheer work and unity means development in a country and that is what Tanzanians are seeing. Mwalimu Nyerere had a dream of uniting the citizens and neighbouring nations to the extent of creating the first East Africa Community (EAC) so that their nationals live in peace and work to develop the bloc. This was extended down south the African continent and midwifed the Southern African Development Community (SADC), a Regional Economic Community comprising 16 Member State of Angola, Botswana, Comoros, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, among others to further commit integration and poverty eradication. As a major force behind the modern Pan-African movement and one of the founders in 1963 of the Organisation of the Africa Unity (OAU), Nyerere was a strong advocate of economic and political measures in dealing with the apartheid policies of South Africa. He was the chairman of a group of five frontline African presidents who advocated the overthrow of white supremacy in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), South Africa, and South West Africa/Namibia (now Namibia), bearing in mind that a slaved (read colonized man) is in shackles and can not independently develop, but must work to serve his/her master. With this background after independence and freedom the nationals have in their countries, what remains is pure work and avoid politicking day in day out. There is no point to keep on blaming colonial masters for woes in the society, but everyone must now work to address them. To reinforce this, Mwalimu Nyerere introduced the Arusha Declaration to see into it that wherever possible the government itself with the citizens, directly participates in the economic development of the country. Paying lip service without ‘walking Mwalimu talks’ will not help to realize his goals, what the citizens and other countries must do to show respect to him posthumously is to implement his ideas to the end. Tanzanians should lead in maintaining peace in the region and always preach peace, patriotism and hard work to shelf off poverty, which not only makes the country and continent depend on foreign aid but also enslaves
