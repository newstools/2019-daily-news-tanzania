MBAO FC assistant coach Abdulmutik Haji has admitted that the going is tough for his team in the ongoing Mainland Premier League. Speaking after their 1-1 draw with Mwadui FC at CCM Kambarage stadium over the weekend, Haji said the league is tough as every team is fighting hard to get good results. But, he also blamed poor officiating from the central referee Abdallah Mwinyimkuu from Tanga who denied his side a penalty when his striker Wazir Junior was fouled in the penalty area by Mwadui FC defender Joram Mgeveke in the 40th minute. The host goal was netted by Gerald Mdamu in the 58th minute while the former Kumnyange and Toto Africans defender Chilo Mkama equalized for Mbao FC in the 90 minutes after connecting a corner kick expertly taken by Datius Peter. He called upon the teamâ€™s supporters in Mwanza to continue supporting their team wholeheartedly in all Premier League matches. Mbao FC who are sponsored by GF trucks are now placed ninth in the ongoing premier league standings after gathering six points in their fivegame outings. They have won one, lost one and drawn three matches. On his side, Mwadui FC midfielder Emmanuel Memba said their team made mistakes that led Mbao FC to equalize in the injury time. He called upon their fans not to give up, but they should continue supporting their team.
