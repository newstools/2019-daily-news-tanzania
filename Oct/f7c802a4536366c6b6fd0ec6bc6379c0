TANZANIA Swimming Association (TSA), has launched a special programme to teach the game in local Primary and Secondary schools in the country. The programme launched yesterday, aims to spread the game in the country and scout many talented swimmers. The newly launched project will be conducted by prominent coaches and TSA’s technical department. The pilot stage drew 100 athletes from six schools in the Dar es Salaam Region who learned various swimming tactics and techniques. TSA Technical Director, Amina Mfaume named the schools as Diamond, Olympio and Upanga for primary schools while secondary schools were Azania, Jangwani and Zanaki. She said that the programme is part of the TSA projects to mark the World Swimming Federation (Fina), aquatic day which reaches its climax on Saturday at the Shaaban Robert Secondary school. “This is one way of promoting the game and spreading it to the communities. There is a notion that swimming is a special game for International Schools only. It is the wrong perception, “ said Mfaume. Mfaume said the new swimmers will learn various swimming strokes, water safety and swimming for survival. The beginners will have to display what they have learnt during the occasion closing ceremony. She said that they have prepared various activities during the closing ceremony aiming to make the day colorful. Some of the activities are water polo competitions among competitive swimmers against coaches, clubs against clubs and officials. The closing ceremony will take place at the Shaaban Robert Secondary school from 8 am to 3 pm. “All TSA officials, as well as swimming stakeholders, are expecting to attend the closing ceremony. We expect more than 400 people to attend,” she said.
