THE fierce race for National Rally Championship (NRC) has been shifted to group A category with Dharam Pandya and Randeep are clear favourites. Guru Nanak Rally to be staged in Arusha early November will decide who deserves the title after Tufail Tufail, who is perched at the helm of the national driving championship race with 85 points, has been assured a Group S title even if he doesn’t win the final round. With 85 points, Tufail is 37.5 points superior to his closest challenger Pandya, who parades 47.5 points. “Group title is wide open to three of us and the last round hopefully will decide who deserves it,” said Pandya who drives Subaru Impreza. The race for the Group A champions has been the talk of the Guru Nanak Rally, ahead of its showdown early next month, according to Pandya. Third overall is Randeep Birdi who has accumulated 43 points. Also likely to challenge the duo is Arusha’s Gurpal Sandhu is fourth placed with 40 points. The Mitsubishi Evo X driver is ahead of his closest challenger Mandeep Singh from Kilimanjaro who has perched 30.5 points. His biggest point reap was in the Oryx Rally where he bagged 22.5 points. With 25 points up for a grab, it means Tufail has already won the championship, none of his closest challengers will manage to beat the 85-point gap. Does Pandya win the last round in Arusha, he will collect 72.5 points while if Birdi wins it he will be able to haul 68 points. The only remaining title for all three; Pandya, Birdi and Sandhu is group A category and one of three can grab it. Sixth-placed Ahmed Huwel from Iringa is far from the championship title having gained 25 points. He won all points in Iringa Rally which he won in Ford Proto. Others with seeding points are Altaf Munge with 22 points, Kelvin Taylor with 21 points, Harinder Deere with 18 points. But none of them can win the title with two more rallies remaining.
