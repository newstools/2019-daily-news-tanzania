PRESIDENT Ali Mohamed Shein has called for patience pending release of the initial oil and natural gas status, soon. Dr Shein, speaking upon arrival from a five-day visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) where he met leaders of the Middle East Countries and management of RAK Gas L.L.C Company that is undertaking the project, said: “During the working tour of Ras Al Khaimah, I visited the RAK Gas Company and met the management. I was eager to learn about the development after the first phase of exploration but I was asked to wait.” He told reporters at the Abeid Amani Karume International Airport (AAKIA) that the government was fully committed to oil and gas exploration project because it is not against the constitution as rumoured by some people, including through the social media. “We have not violated the constitution, those misleading the public should be ignored,” he said. After phase one of the exploration, the interpretation results were expected by last September. And, after data interpretation, geologists will come in to advise on the next move. Last year, Zanzibar government signed production sharing agreement (PSA) with the United Arab Emirates-based RAKGAS Company to pave way for oil and gas exploration activities in the Indian Ocean archipelago. The agreement covers the Pemba-Zanzibar block and involves exploration, development, production and ultimate sharing of benefits derived from the found resources. The targeted Zanzibar block has undergone several field activities including pre-drilling aerial exploration over and deployment of offshore infrastructure for drilling of test wells. Zanzibar currently relies on cloves export, tourism, and services for its revenue, but the authorities say the discovery of Oil and Gas will change the lives of its people.
