ACCESS BANK Tanzania has imparted skills on financial management and sound business ethics to 300 micro, agro and deposit customers in Kahama District. Kahama District Commissioner (DC), Anamringi Macha said the forums held recently in Kahama, Shinyanga Region was an opportunity for the business community to grow their businesses through loan provision or savings. “The government is on a drive to industrialise and this forum will assist addressing and pushing Kahama’s micro businesses to achieve this goal. I would like to thank AccessBank for creating these opportunities, looking forward to being invited to the next forum,” he said. The bank’s Chief Business Officer Mr Prosper Gwemella noted that, “Facilitated by the global spread of Mobile Phones, Agents (Wakala’s), ATM’s, it bridges some of the gaps by expanding access to financial services to hard-to-reach communities and small businesses at a low cost,” Technology is the way forward and a faster solution and in some situations can be counterproductive to initiatives by bringing financial services to banked and unbanked customers. “This forum will also educate you with the right understanding and know how to grow your business operations in the long-run,” he said. The forum was organized in partnership with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and Mr Eric Crispin who is AccessBank’s business trainer for the forums explained, “We all pay taxes, but it is very important to manage your books so that the tax man understands your business cash-flow.
