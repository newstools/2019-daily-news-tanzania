THE government assured yesterday that it will monitor closely the generation and use of scrap metal and toxic waste that are generated in Tanzania and ensure local industries make most of the waste. The pledge was made by the Minister of State in the Vice-President’s Office (Union and Environment), Mr George Simbachawene when he addressed workers at Dar es Salaam-based OK Plast after touring the factory. He said the plant proved the usefulness of a government ban on wholesale export of scrap metal and toxic wasted that was imposed a few months back. “I thank OK Plast because you have shown why the government slapped the ban on export of scrap metal and toxic waste. Local industries are very important in generating job, producing export goods and this is what is happening here. Exports are earning us foreign currency and adding value to the shilling. We salute you,” he told his audience. The plant produces copper cables and mats using materials from ineffective car batteries. The minister advised industries using copper to make industrial goods to have elaborate plans for buying copper from local miners.
