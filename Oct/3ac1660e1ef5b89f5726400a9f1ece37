FORCING children into early marriage and subjecting them to child labour is against the law, Dodoma District Commissioner (DC) Patrobas Katambi has warned, saying stern measures will be taken against the culprits. Mr Katambi noted that parents who collaborated with perpetrators would equally be prosecuted. The DC gave the warning yesterday while addressing girl students at Mnadani Dodoma Secondary School. He said; “the time for girls is now and no one is allowed to block their education ambitions through early or forced marriage.” “This is the commitment of the entire government. The fifth phase government has made it clear by promoting free education,” he said. “As aides of the President, our responsibility is to ensure all children have equal access to education.” He said the government was waging war on violence against a girl child. He urged the community to protect the rights of the girl child which he said was under attack. “If our Head of State has given so many leadership positions to women then it is our responsibility to ensure our daughters receive good education to come and serve their country in various positions,” he explained. Mr Katambi used the opportunity to warn parents who promoted outdated cultural practices especially by agreeing to marry off their children while they were still studying as well as committing other cruel acts, including female genital mutilation, saying the government was watching. He noted that to have a strong middle-income economy, “we must also acknowledge the uplifting of women and the fight against cultural practices that are detrimental to girls.” “We cannot accept to see our daughters missing out on education that the President has given us for free because of some men who marry students or of parents who will receive bride wealth,” he said.
