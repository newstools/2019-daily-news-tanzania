VICE-PRESIDENT Samia Suluhu Hassan is expected to grace the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) seminar expected to take place in Arusha this weekend. CPA has prepared a four-day seminar for Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians expected to kick off on Saturday this week, according to the Speaker of the National Assembly, Job Ndugai. “The VP will officiate the opening ceremony on Sunday, and I am glad that she has confirmed participation,’’ said Mr Ndugai. Addressing a news conference here yesterday, Mr Ndugai said the seminar will bring together about 50 delegates from South Africa, Botswana, Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Nigeria, Namibia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Seychelles, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. During the seminar, he said several issues will be discussed, including building democracy through women participation in electoral processes as voters and candidates, barriers against women participation in elections, violence and discriminatory practices against women during elections, as well as women politicians and the media and post-election engagement. According to Mr Ndugai, the seminar comes at a time when the country is stretching political muscles ahead of the much awaited local government election scheduled for November 24.
