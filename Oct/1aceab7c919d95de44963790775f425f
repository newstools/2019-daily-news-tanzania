MINERALS Ministry has assigned the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM) with the role of nurturing Dodoma Mineral Resources Institute. Permanent Secretary in the Ministry Professor Somon Msanjila and UDSM Vice- Chancellor Professor William Anangisye signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the institute in Dar es Salaam, yesterday. Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology Professor Leonard Akwilapo witnessed the signing event. Prof Msanjila said the MoU will allow the country’s oldest university to nurture the mineral institute in terms of programmes offered, education quality and competence of trainers. UDSM also has to ensure that the institute is well placed in terms of infrastructures. “It is my hope that the University of Dar es Salaam will review the curriculums, teachers’ welfare and infrastructures to support the institute in delivery of high quality education,” he said. Prof Msanjila said the ministry is ready to receive any suggestion from UDSM towards ensuring the institute is well managed. He assured employees at the institute that the handing over of the institute to UDSM will not in any way affect their employment. “No worker at the institute will lose his/her job,” Professor Msanjila said, adding that employees with unfit qualifications for their positions will be transferred to the ministry, with their salaries remaining untouched. Prof Akwilapo said UDSM will perform the assignment as demanded to ensure better and quality experts are produced in the mineral sector. Professor Anangisye said the university is ready to take the role of fostering the mineral institute with high integrity to achieve the outlined goals.
