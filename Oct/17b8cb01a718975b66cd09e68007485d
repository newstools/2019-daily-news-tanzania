A 94-year-old granny in Manyara is now seeking the regional commissioner’s office assistance to retain her 300 acre farm from the government. Ms Martha Kuzilwa claims to have her lost possession of her precious land she owned since 1965. The granny accuses the Loisinyai Village Executive Officer (VEO), Mr Lengai Pateli of conniving the village government to prohibit her from cultivating on the land.

According to Ms Kuzilwa, the two claimed that she was had no full ownership of the 300-acres farm, save for the 50 acres. “I had to bring all farming activities to a halt because the two were determined to inflict more misery on me,” said the granny when addressing the area Regional Commissioner (RC) Mr Alexander Mnyeti. Detailing the genesis of the problem, the nanny said it all began when her children brought her a tractor and ploughs that enable her develop the area. The nanny also accused village government members for teaming up with the two in ensuring that she losses the land to the government. In his response, the regional commissioner directed the village executive officer and the area division officer to have the nanny placed under 24-hour security protection following the threats. Mr Mnyeti also directed the village officials to suspend all activities on the disputed land until the matter was resolved. The regional commissioner requested the 94-yearold woman to avail her with authentic documents to show that she legally owned the land.
