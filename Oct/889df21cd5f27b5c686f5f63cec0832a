PRESIDENT Ali Mohamed Shein is today expected to launch the electronic Zanzibari National Identification Card (ZanID) which all eligible Zanzibaris should have by the end of next year. Zanzibar Civil Status Registration Agency (ZCSRA) Executive Director, Dr Hussein Khamis Shaaban, said yesterday 400 smart cards would be distributed to senior leaders at the event to be held at Sheikh Idriss Abdulwakil Hall. “The ZanID smart card is one of the best in Africa,” said Dr Shaaban at a press conference ahead of the launch of new ID cards to replace the non-electronic ones. He said the new smart cards had four features in the chip: electronic Identification (e-ID), electronic driving licence (e-DL), electronic health card (ehealth) and electronic wallet (e-wallet). The executive director informed journalists that the new ZanID would be also used in the registration of mobile phone numbers and other social businesses because “We are working closely with our colleagues in the National Identification Authority (NIDA) issuing the national IDs.” The Zanzibar Civil Status Registration Agency was established under the Act No 3 of 2018 to be responsible for births, identification cards, marriages, divorces and deaths. However, the issuance of ZanID started in 2005.
