The drop in the total market capitalization was mostly a result of price deceleration on the East African Breweries Limited (DSE: EABL), by 3.64 per cent and a 1.49 per cent drop on the Acacia (DSE: ACA), counter due to changes in the exchange rate. A respective 6.21 per cent and 4.55 per cent increase in prices on Jubilee Holdings Limited (DSE: JHL) and KCB Bank (DSE: KCB), was not high enough to neutralize the drop on Acacia and EABL.
