SHINYANGA Regional Commissioner (RC) Zainab Telack has directed all Lake Zone residents to ensure they protect water sources. Speaking at a meeting of Lake Zone regional commissioners meeting prepared by Lake Victoria Basin Board (LVBB), the RC said human activities in the Lake Zone were detrimental to sustainable water sources. She added that activities like charcoal burning around Lake Victoria threatened water sources and led to massive deforestation. She added that deforestation further led to soil erosion which was causing siltation in some parts of Lake Victoria. According to her, she said it was not the duty of LVBB to protect water sources, but the duty of every one. She directed the ward officers to make sure they educated their residents on the importance of environmental conservation. Ms Telack called upon members of the public to stop grazing their cattle near water sources and directed miners to stop mining activities near the lake. LVBB Chairman Boniventure Baya said their board had the mandate to manage and conserve water sources, according to the Water Resources Management Act No 23 of 2009. Mr Baya said the board faced a lot challenges related to the conservation of water sources such as climate change, illegal fishing and water pollution in some of rivers located near Lake Victoria. He further said the government was working with stakeholders, including the National Environment Management Council (NEMC) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) to educate people on the importance of conserving and protecting water sources.
