WOMEN in the country have been encouraged to enter investment fray and do away with the mindset that opportunities are only for foreigners. The remarks were made in Dar es Salaam yesterday by Tanzania Investment Centre (TIC), Promotion Investment Manager Ms Haighat Kitaka while launching the Ignite Business Clinic (IBC) organised by K-Finance Limited. “Some women have been doing business for a very long time in the country but most of them still view investing as a complex pursuit only for the wealthy and foreigners,” she noted. Ms Kitaka further explained that there were plenty of opportunities in Tanzania, thus TIC has been encouraging locals to come out in large numbers and invest in sectors like telecommunication, tourism, banking and mining. For local investors, she said one requires to have a 50mil/-capital or more in which one must first follow all the requirements before consulting TIC, including registering a company with relevant authorities. She further said since Tanzania had assumed the Southern African Development Community (SADC) chairmanship it was a good opportunity for women to exploit the available opportunities in member countries, including investing. She cautioned, however, that they needed to the local market before spreading their wings. K- Finance limited, Founder Ms Devotha Minzi said some business people in the country had been taking a lot of things for granted. “It is high time people changed their mindset towards business as some who are employed think that once they venture into entrepreneurship it is when they will have time to relax,” she remarked. On employment creation, she said the task should not be left to the government alone but cover all actors, including the youth.
