THE national open swimming championships have been scheduled to take place on October 26 and 27 at the International School of Tanganyika (IST) Limited Masaki. The event will feature all clubs from Mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar according to Tanzania Swimming Association (TSA) secretary-general, Inviolata Itatiro. Inviolata said that swimmers will contest in four age categories, namely, nine and 10 years group, 11-12, 13-14 and 15 years and over respectively. She said that the winners in each event will be awarded medals. The first, second and third would be awarded gold, silver, and bronze respectively. In age groups, first and second would be awarded trophies while open events will be based on the final place rather than the age group. “All open events will be awarded based on a final place. Open events will count towards individual points whereby the first placed swimmer will be awarded 20 points while second and third would be awarded 16 and 14 points respectively,” said Inviolata. The fourth-placed winner will take home 12 points while fifth (10 points), sixth (8 points), seventh (6 points), eighth (4 points), ninth (2 points) and tenth-placed will be awarded one point. According to Inviolata, only swimmers whose clubs have paid the annual membership fee and are registered members of TSA are allowed to compete in the event if they have met the qualifying times. She explained that only swimmers who have attained times in competitions held from January 1st are accepted. Inviolata said each swimmer is eligible to compete in up to eight (8) individual events and two (2) relay events. “Entry submission strictly closes at midnight on Monday 20th October 2019, clubs are urged to receive.
