DAR ES SALAAM University College of Education (DUCE) has extended its health coverage, thanks to the launch of Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) Dispensary. The modern health facility, which has been singlehandedly financed by the university at about 60m/-, will cater for DUCE students and nearby residents. In her remarks during the launch of RCH at DUCE campus recently, Ms Aimbora Aminiel Nnko, who represented the Temeke District Commissioner, commended DUCE for complementing the fifth phase government under President John Magufuli in improving health services. “What you have accomplished is truly recommendable because you will be directly touching the lives of many people and let me declare here that I will be one of your regular customers,” Ms Nnko noted. She urged university management to consider setting aside one emergency room at the facility which could be used to handle immediate cases. Earlier, DUCE Principal, Prof Bernadeta Killian, said the dispensary offered health services to 15,138 people who included students, the staff and nearby residents from July 2018 to June this year. “At the moment, plans are underway to upgrade this dispensary and turn it into a specialised clinic so that it may offer better health services,” she noted. Furthermore, Prof Killian noted that the university would be able to generate income from the facility that would improve other DUCE activities. However, on behalf of fellow colleagues at the dispensary Dr Violet Salewa said the number of people coming for health services was going to double. “Previously, we used to direct patients to other places, but with the construction of RCH, all their cases will be treated here,” she said. She then requested DUCE management to increase the number of staff working at the dispensary to improve health services.
