THE Minister of State in the President’s Office (Regional Administration and Local Government) Selemani Jafo has directed all district authorities to open a special account for preserving 10 per cent of the funds obtained from internal revenue sources for issuing loans to the youth, women and people with disabilities. Equally, the minister has said his ministry intends to set aside funds for community development officers so that they can make a close followup and assess the loans issued to all targeted groups. He was speaking during the closing of a workshop for community development experts held in Dodoma. “I had at some point issued a directive to all district authorities to open special accounts for women and youth empowerment groups as well as people with disabilities,” he noted adding: “By November 30 this year, all district and town councils should open the accounts because it is a legal requirement.” Mr Jafo said putting the money in one basket was very risk as it was difficult to trace how it was spent. Therefore, he added, all authorities needed to have a special account for that purpose by the end of this month. The minister further told delegates that he would consider setting aside funds for community development experts so that they could make timely follow-ups and assessment. He said it was difficult for the officers to make assessment if they were not empowered financially because they needed to make followups to ensure the loans transformed the lives of people. On the eagerly awaited local government elections, the minister asked community development officers to intensify public awareness so that more people could participate by collecting forms to vie for various leadership positions and voting on November 24. “As community development officers you have a role to play by convincing people to participate in the elections and encouraging them to vie for various positions as well as voting,” he stressed.
