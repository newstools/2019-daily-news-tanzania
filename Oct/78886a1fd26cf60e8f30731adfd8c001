PRESIDENT Ali Mohamed Shein has met with the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs and Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Guo Yezhou at the State House, assuring him of continued collaboration. “It is impossible to talk about Zanzibar’s development achievement without China, the country which has been supporting our country since after the 1964 revolution,” Dr Shein said as he mentioned several successful projects that are linked to China. The construction of a sugar factory in Mahoda village, construction of a cigarettes factory and other light industries in the 1970s, ongoing study programmes, the building of Abdalla-Mzee Hospital in Pemba, and the recent completion of the Mao Zedong project are some the big projects supported by China. Shein thanked the visiting Chinese deputy minister for his tour of Tanzania and Zanzibar, appreciating also the CPC party’s major contribution to development of Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) as the strongest party in the country. Mr Yezhou said China values the good relations with Tanzania and other countries in the continent, as it also maintained relationship with South Africa’s African National Congress (ANC), People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), South West African People’s Organization (SWAPO) of Namibia, Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) and Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO). President Shein and Yezhou reiterated a call for commitment in strengthening relations for the benefit of their people. The meeting at the State House was also attended by China Consular General in Zanzibar, Mr Xie Xiaowu and CCM’s deputy Secretary General (Zanzibar) Dr Abdalla Juma Mabodi.
