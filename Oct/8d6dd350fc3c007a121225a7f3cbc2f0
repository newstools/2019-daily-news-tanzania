FORM IV students at Nkende Secondary School in Tarime Town Council in Mara Region have thanked the government for giving them free education. Those who spoke to the ‘Daily News’ in Tarime on behalf of their colleagues recently, said they were well prepared to sit the form four national examinations scheduled for early next month. “Since we are the first products of free education, we promise our President that we will perform well in the our examinations,” Faustine Ghati Paul, remarked. “The free education programme has been very beneficial to many of us. In the past some students could not achieve their dreams by becoming doctors or joining other fields due to lack of school fees. We are very grateful to the government, Rhobi Joseph Thomas, another candidate, said. The co-educational school has a total of 159 students who will join thousands other students across the country to sit the exams. The academic teacher, Mr Gideon Chacha, said the students are ready for the examinations after intensive preparations that involved committed teachers. The headmaster, Mr Samson Hagai, said over 800 students, majority of whom are from low-income families, are currently benefiting from the fifth phase government’s free education programme. “The free education system has reduced the burden that faced parents and guardians in the past and this is indeed a big motivation for bright students coming from low-income families who could not afford to pay school fees in the past”, Mr Hagai said. The enrollment had also increased sharply, the headmaster said. The fifth government introduced free education for primary and secondary school students as soon as Dr Magufuli ascended to the presidency.
