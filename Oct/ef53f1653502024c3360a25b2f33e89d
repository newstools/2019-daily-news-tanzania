NMB Bank plans to increase the number of best loan paying Small and Medium Entrepreneurs (SMEs) customers who will visit China next year as a practical part for what they learn in the business clubs to acquire skills for growing and expanding their businesses. The NMB Head of Business Banking, Donatus Richard said in Dar es Salaam over the weekend that helping SMEs grow and expand their businesses beyond financing is one of the bank’s priorities. “The bank is planning to increase the number of customers to make a practical tour to China next year after successfully flying 10 SMEs early this month,” he said adding that business Clubs teach them how to register, keep records and practically going to China was practical part of learning at the club. Lending SMEs is important in growing and expanding businesses but never guarantees its sustainability. NMB plays a major role for SMEs growth and sustainability by sanctioning loans and imparting financial skills to keep the business growing. Some of the SMEs who early this month flew to China said that the trip was an eye opener and has shaped their way of doing successful businesses. An entrepreneur from Morogoro Ms Rehema Mmari owning Shambani Milk processing industry hailed NMB’s initiative to arrange the learning tour to China that has opened immense opportunities for growing and expanding their businesses. “Through the trip, have met with manufacturers of various plants for milk processing that may help to increase our production to meet the high market demand,” she said. On his part, Award Mpandila dealing with motorcycle spare parts said through the trip to China has helped to network with manufacturers and giving new idea to establish small scale plant to make some parts of the motorcycle domestically instead of importing them. “I met with manufacturers of various spare parts for motorcycles and pledged to work closely to find ways of partnering and establishing small scale industries in the country,” he said.
