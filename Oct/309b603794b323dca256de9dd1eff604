AT least 20 companies have participated in free health screening as part of campaign for eradicating Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). AAR Insurance Company Managing Director, Ms Violet Modichai who organised the function that took place in Dar es Salaam said her company decided to bring together various stakeholders and engage them in sport as a strategy for motivating them in the fight against NCDs. “The move also aims at supporting the government efforts to end the problem. The government has been encouraging wananchi to go for test, we are therefore taking part in building a healthy nation,” she noted. She added that NCDs are increasing at an alarming rate and has also become a major cause of deaths in the country. She encouraged the public to register for insurance so that it could be easier for them to access quality health services. The AAR boss commended the government move to ensuring every Mwananchi possesses health insurance saying such efforts set a platform for accessing quality and required health services across the country. Precision Air Public Relations Manager, Mr Hillary Mremi, who was among the participants of the sports activities, commended AAR for taking the initiative in ensuring provision of reliable services to its customers.
