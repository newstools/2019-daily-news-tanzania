AUTHORITIES in Kagera are working on initiatives to conduct measles-rubella and polio vaccinations, which target over 800,000 children aged five years and below. Kagera Regional Medical Officer (RMO), Dr Marco Mbata, told the “Daily News” in an interview in Bukoba yesterday that about 492,393 children are expected to get measles- rubella (MR) vaccinations and 226,066 to get polio (IPV) immunisations. “The campaign is part of the government plan to reduce the number of deaths and disabilities, resulting from vaccine preventable diseases. The campaign was earlier scheduled for last month, but it was postponed to October 17 to 21 this year. I appeal to residents in the area to cooperate with the government to make it successful,” he said. The RMO further noted that the government was committed to ensure that the citizens get maximum social services including health, education and water infrastructure, adding that all necessary logistics had been made to ensure that the campaign becomes successful. Citing measles status in the country, the Minister for Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, Ms Ummy Mwalimu last month said that the disease was reported in Kashasha and Kakoma Divisions and Kibare village in Kyerwa District in Kagera Region. She said that the last patient with measles symptoms was reported on September 14 this year at Kibare area. “There is no other patient who has been reported in the past two weeks, and those who contacted the disease have recovered, health personnel have been educating people on preventive measures against the disease and creating awareness at the countrywide campaign,” she said.
