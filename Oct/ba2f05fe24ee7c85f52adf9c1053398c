ENERGY and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority (EWURA) in Arusha has issued a stern warning to uncertified electricians. The regulator was categorical that it will not spare any quack electricians caught wiring a house. It maintained at the weekend here that it was against the law and professional conduct for an uncertified electrician to engage in wiring of houses. “We are currently waging a war against such individuals; our target is to flush them out, wherever they may be,” explained Engineer Lorivii Long’idu, EWURA’s regional manager. Engineer Long’idu, who was addressing electrical contractors and engineers here, challenged those masquerading as genuine electricians to enroll for right courses before they get certified. “The rules require any person conducting a licensed must apply for a permit from EWURA by filling in application forms,” he explained. He urged electricians to have valid licenses that will identify them with their tools of trade. “For those whose licenses have expired should come to our offices to have them renewed,” he said. Many wiremen and electricians in the region have not been registered by the regulator, apparently operating as quacks, endangering security as a consequence. In the same vein, the EWURA regional manager took issue with electrical contractors who connive with the quacks in issuing approving electricity connection requests to unsuspecting customers
