THE State of Palestine has expressed its readiness to collaborate with the Tanzanian government in improving various sectors, including health, agriculture and industry. Speaking to reporters on Saturday in Dar es Salaam, Minister of Justice from the State of Palestine, Prof Mohamad Shalaldeh, expressed his government commitment after attending the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organisation’s 58th (AALCO) session in Dar es Salaam. “We will continue to support the government’s efforts in improving the lives of the people, especially in the areas that will be decided,” he said. According to him, Palestine appreciates the good work by President John Magufuli, and that Palestinians have trust and confidence in the vision of the president towards bringing positive changes in the country and were ready to support the government. He said for some years, Palestinians have been facing various challenges as they continue with their struggle. However, during that hard time, they have managed to build their economy and establish some businesses, which they could also share with Tanzanians.
