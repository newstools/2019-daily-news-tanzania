LIVESTOCK and Fisheries Minister Luhaga Mpina yesterday ordered the formation of fishing cooperative societies countrywide to help fishermen switch from subsistence to commercial fishing. He issued the directive here while inaugurating Igombe Fishing Cooperative Society and instructed Permanent Secretary in the Ministry to make sure there are at least 20 cooperatives, countrywide, by the year end. He clarified that the cooperatives will help in among others, giving members’ access to bank loans to boost their fishing activities. “The government is determined to promote fishermen whose activities contribute to national economic growth. Their activities also play an important role towards availability of foreign currencies,” he said, hinting that fish exports have increased to 691bn/- from last year’s 379bn/-. He said the government’s efforts in promoting the fishing sector, fish imports have tremendously dropped from the average of 56bn/- in 2017 to 17bn/- in this year. The minister added that in the current financial year, the government will not spend a single cent on fish import, thanks to remarkable improvements in the fishing sector where local fishermen have been doing the best to meet the domestic market’s demand. “We are also thankful to the Postal Bank which supports the ministry’s endeavors and valuing the great job that has been done by local fishermen, hence, opening bank accounts for them on free conditions,” said Mr Mpina. Igombe cooperative society, which has 46 members, has succeeded to accumulate 20m/- capital. About 7.5m/- was from members themselves, 10m/- from the ministry’s contribution and 2.5m/- from Ilemela Member of Parliament Angeline Mabula.
