THE government has begun to pay 7.7bn/- as compensation to 2,868 residents of Mombose and Bubutole villages in Chemba District to give room for a mega water project in Farkwa Dam. Chemba District Commissioner (DC), Simon Odunga noted in a press statement released by the Communications Unit of the Water Ministry that the process is expected to be completed by November 30th. "I appeal to Mombose and Bubutole residents to comply with a notice that compels them to vacate the area surrounding Farkwa Dam within three months beginning November to January, 2020," reads part of the statement quoting the DC. The mega water project in Farkwa Dam is aimed at addressing the water disequilibrium in Dodoma City in the wake of the government's relocation to the capital city from Dar es Salaam. Presently, Dodoma has a capacity to produce 61,500 litres of water daily. Mr Odunga explained that a team of land surveyors from Chemba District Council will embark on a land survey exercise in Swakaleto and Manyata areas, whereby those living near Farkwa Dam will be relocated. According to the Executive Director of Dodoma Urban Water and Sanitation Authority (DUWASA), Engineer David Pallangyo, the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for the water project was complete. Engineer Pallangyo pointed out that ESIA was conducted by Dar es Salaam-based Tres Consult Limited and that feasibility study for the project was conducted by M/S Tractebel Engineering from France. Mr Michael Stio, one of the residents due to receive compensation, expressed gratitude to the fifth phase government for keeping its promise to that end. "We are grateful to the government for keeping its promise and allowing us to cultivate short term crops in our villages pending relocation to other areas," said the resident.
