COMMONWEALTH Women Parliamentarians (CWP) is determined to engage the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA) in advancing women participation in electoral processes. Fielding questions from journalists at the East African Community (EAC) headquarters here yesterday, CWP Chairperson Shandana Gulzar Khan said the two bodies had agreed to work closely in championing the cause. “We want to make women empowerment the centre of our relationship,” disclosed the CWP when she visited the EAC organ. To achieve the task, Ms Khan pointed out that the women parliamentarians from the commonwealth countries will continue engaging EALA’s women caucus and eventually take the relationship to the next level. “The two organs will closely work for a seamless growth; should EALA be in need of manpower, expertise or any sort of documentation, we will be more than ready to step in,” she assured. According to Ms Khan, CWP had a lot to learn from the East African countries, particularly in empowering women to run for top political positions. Citing her country of Pakistan, the CWP Chairperson said cultural practices proved to be a major hindrance to women empowerment. “For us, the EAC serves as the best example to follow, back in Pakistan, we have male and female sections for MPs,” she explained. Ms Khan described her country as a pragmatic nation that needs to strive to increase the number of women participating in decision making. “We must have a rational way of looking at things,” she said. EALA Speaker Martin Ngoga noted that Africa was doing better in things that it’s mostly being criticised about. He said Africans shouldn’t be complacent of its modest achievement. “As parliamentarians, we have a role of lifting our people out of poverty,” he observed. He assured the CWP of continued support in championing the cause of advancing women’s participation in electoral processes
