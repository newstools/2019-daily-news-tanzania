THE City of Arusha was literary a beehive of activity as parents from all walks of life filled up uniform and bookstores as schools reopen today. For the part of the weekend, the parents, some accompanied by their children thronged the shops, hoping to salvage something, from stationery to school uniforms. The parents however accused the traders for making a kill come every first week of January. This paper visited a number of bookstores within the city including Bora Bookshop, Bookpoint Bookshop and Kase stores this past weekend and witnessed scores of parents sampling text books and uniforms for their children. Speaking separately to ‘Daily News’, the parents blamed the owners of bookstores and secretarial bureaus for hiking prices of school supplies. “We came here hoping we’ll buy many books for our children, only to end up getting few supplies for them,” lamented Evans Lyakurwa a Kisongo resident. Mr Lyakurwa urged the government to intervene and stop the owners from charging them at exorbitant prices. Sharing similar sentiments, Ms Juliana Mollel, whose child joins Secondary Education today, said their children are forced to report to school with fewer books because they can’t afford the charges. “At times we ask them to share with their colleagues while in class as we struggle to raise money to buy more text books and related items,’” she observed. But in his rejoinder, a book seller at Bora Bookshop who preferred to remain anonymous as he wasn’t authorised to speak to the media, blamed the parents for not sparing enough time to start shopping for the children, waiting for the last moment to do that, amidst increased prices in the supplies. “Most of the parents like to wait until the very last moment to start shopping when they had the whole of December to do so,” he said. Most schools reopen today after long holidays that began in early December.
