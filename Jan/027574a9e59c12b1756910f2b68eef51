Tanzania posts cooperation (TPC) has been told to set up strategic plan for updating current business model to compete in the market, reach more people and generate profit. “Use modern ICT infrastructures to reach more customers while competing in a way private sector competes,” the Minister for Works, Transport and Communications, Mr Isack Kamwelwe said this in Dar es Salaam over the weekend after opening TPC’s workers’ council. The plan should include setting post offices in all of 186 districts in the country to bring close postal services while reducing costs to Tanzanians who travel long distances. He told workers’ council to capitalise on the revamped national airline Air Tanzania Company Limited to transport letters and packages within and outside the country as a way of boosting the country’s economy. In his welcoming remarks, TPC’s Postmaster General Hassan Mwang’ombe said the cooperation has embarked on offering money transfer services as well offer financial services through mobile money like services. “TPC is keeping its financial books electronically and it has already connected to the national Data centre and making payment through the Government e- Payment Gateway (GePG) and therefore no more payment will be made physically at the counter,” he said.
