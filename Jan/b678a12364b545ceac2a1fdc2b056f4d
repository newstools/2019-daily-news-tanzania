LIVESTOCK and Fisheries Minister Luhaga Mpina yesterday issued a one-month ultimatum to investors with agreements to invest on Marine Parks and Reserves Unit (MPRU) to pay 331.2m/- they owe the government or face the law. Mr Mpina said failure to respond to the demand in 30 days, the government will revoke all agreements, arrest the defiant investors and seize their properties to compensate the debt. The minister issued the ultimatum when he visited the marine parks and reserved areas in Mbudya and Bongoyo islands on the Indian Ocean. He said the government is not ready to see some investors delaying implementation of some projects as per the terms of agreements, threatening legal measures against the violators. “It is obvious that when an investor fails to implement the projects, he/she denies the government its due tax, we are not ready to see this happening,” he said. The minister argued that Tanzania has so many attractions but there have been little efforts in promoting the attractions. He said there is need for stakeholders to come with plans that will help to promote the unique and attractive areas in the country. Mr Mpina ordered for the formation of the strategy to promote the attractive areas and the document be handed to him on February 28, this year.
