KAMAL Group, in collaboration with Bahari Rotary club, has given prosthetic legs to at least 120 people with disabilities that will enable them engage in various social-economic activities. According to the market price in Tanzania, each leg costs between 1.2 and 3m/-. The support has been extended to people with disabilities through the Peoples’ Empowerment Foundation – PEF. So far, Kamal Group has reached 370 people with disabilities in the country and it has extended its support for the fourth time this year. Speaking during the equipment’s handover to the Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office (Employment, Youth and the Disabled), Ms Stella Ikupa, the Kamal Group Chairman, Mr Gagan Gupta said his company wished to see people with disabilities engaging in various economic activities. “Our aim is to see people with disabilities engaging in activities that will help them to generate income. Through this project, we want to see them doing something tangible for their future,” he noted. He said his company launched the project after realizing the great demand for prosthesis. He said many people needed prosthesis but very few are capable to get them due to difficult economic conditions. For his part, Mr Diamond Carvalho of Bahari Rotary Club said the money for purchasing the equipment was obtained from a year-ender golf game, which took place in Dar es Salaam. He said his club had contributed 23m/-. Ms Ikupa expressed her gratitude to Kamal Group and Bahari Rotary Club for their support to people with disabilities. “I had already talked to PEF on this matter and I am glad they have responded by supporting us,” she said.
