The directive issued a week ago by Katavi Region that all children selected to join Form One should go to school even if they have no school uniforms has seen about 58 percent of them turning up for enrolment. “Two weeks ago only 2,386 Form One students equivalent to 34 per cent of all the 7,000 children selected to join secondary education reported, but after it was announced that Form One students should be allowed to attend classes even if they don't have school uniforms, 4,032 of them reported accordingly. This is equivalent to 58 percent. Surprisingly, all of them were in new school uniforms,” said Katavi Regional Academic Officer, John Pandisha. Parents and guardians of those selected to join Form One early this month were reluctant to buy the school uniform for their children, complaining that they don’t have money, because they are poor. “However, to the surprise of many all 4,032 Form One students reported to their respected schools wearing new school uniforms,” he added. Mr Pandisha said they had discovered that yesterday all district academic officers visited 32 public secondary schools to inspect enrolment and attendance, particularly for Form One students. He said only 582 students had not turned up since January 7, 2019. In another development, Mwangaza Secondary School Headmaster, Simon Lubange said already 315 out of 343 Form One students had reported. He noted that a big challenge facing his school was the reluctance of parents and guardians to contribute food for their children during school hours, particularly lunch time.
