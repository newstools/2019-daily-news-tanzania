THE World Press Photo Foundation has urged local photojournalists to take pictures that will make people feel, think and act for development changes. The foundation made the statement in Dar es Salaam yesterday where together with the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Hivos, Oxfam and the Tanzania Media Women’s Association (TAMWA) have organised a World Press Photo Exhibition 2018. This is the fifth exhibition to be held in Tanzania with the aim of creating a platform for under-recognised talents from each of the world’s six continents, and give them an opportunity to connect to the global audience. Curator of the Foundation, Ms Sophie Boshouwers, who doubles as the Exhibition Manager, said the two-week exhibition which started on Wednesday will provide an opportunity for local photojournalists as well as students to learn from the winners during the last year’s world photo competition. “The stories on the pictures we have chosen are very diverse, we have eight categories…we stand for transparency, accuracy and diversity,” she said as she encouraged local photojournalists to participate in the coming competitions. This is the world’s leading contest. Last year it drew entries from all over the world, where over 4540 photographers from 125 countries submitted 73,044 images. She said this year’s exhibition is special for Tanzania because one of the winning stories includes photos taken by Anna Boyiazis, which captured women taking swimming lessons from an instructor in the northern tip of Zanzibar through the Panje project.
