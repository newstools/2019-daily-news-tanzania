WATER and Irrigation Ministry Permanent Secretary Prof Kitila Mkumbo has directed experts to start reviewing water sources management regulations. He gave the directive here over the weekend, pointing out that the water experts should seek ways that would enable surrounding communities in water sources benefit from the resources. “While satisfying the changing demands of surrounding communities, water resources management should be sustainable,” said the PS during a ceremony to award the Ministry’s Best Employee of the Year for 2017/2018 Financial Year. The event saw TunduruSub-Office Supervisor, Heriel Msangi being awarded the prize after the public servant saved millions of shillings that would have been sunk into a shoddy project for a building that would have housed Ruvuma-South Coast Basin and Likonde Water Consumers Community offices. Prof Mkumbo said the experts should develop a framework for ensuring that surrounding communities in water resources in the country benefit from the resources, saying water was important for all. He observed water resources management policies review was in implementation of President John Magufuli’s directive that surrounding communities in water sources should not be denied access to water resources. “President Magufuli has directed that instead of preventing surrounding communities from using water resources, there should be frameworks for enable the communities benefit from the resources,” he said. As for Best Employee of the Year, Prof Mkumbo described Mr Msangi as a model public servant worthy of emulation by other public servants. “His diligence has helped our ministry to win a case against a contractor, M/S Saro Builders Company Limited who executed substandard construction project,” said the Permanent Secretary. Mr Msangi expressed gratitude to the Ministry for recognising his contribution to save the ministry’s resources, saying the award had motivated him to improve his performance.
