TANZANIA’S exports to the United States of America has reached $42m/- between October 2017 and September 2018, according to findings published by the United States Agency for International Development’s East Africa Trade and Investment Hub. Released late last month, the findings indicate that the East African nation posted a seven per cent increase from the same period the previous year. “Tanzania experienced a rise of seven per cent to $42.1 million, Uganda had a 49 per cent increase to $3.2 million, and Rwanda went up 49 per cent to $5.8 million,” read part of the findings. According to the report, East African countries supported by the USAID Hub reached nearly $1bn/- in exports to the US under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), between October 2017 and September 2018. “To date, USAID Hub trade and investment support has contributed $4.07 billion in Agoa exports from the region, with $491.5 million from Hub-supported firms,” the Hub said. This was a 17 per cent rise over figures from the previous year, and a 42 per cent increase since the USAID Hub began. Kenya remains the largest exporter in eastern Africa with a total of $454m/-. The findings show that Ethiopia experienced the largest increase in AGOA exports; the country’s total jumped 62 per cent in one year. Almost all other countries saw their exports grow, with the exceptions of Mauritius and Burundi. Mauritius has witnessed increased competition since Madagascar regained its AGOA eligibility. Burundi, while not AGOA-eligible, saw its exports under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) drop. Rwanda, Uganda, Madagascar, Tanzania and Kenya have developed national Agoa strategies to support critical sectors and items to maximise the dutyfree benefits. Ethiopia is in the process of updating its national strategy. Products that can enter the US market under the agreement include textiles and apparels, specialty foods, footwear, cut flowers, home décor and fashion accessories. Tanzania is currently US’s 137th largest goods trading partner with $269mn/- in total goods trade during 2017. Goods exports totaled $145 million; goods imports totaled $124mn/- . The US goods trade surplus with Tanzania was $22mn in 2017. US’s foreign direct investment in Tanzania (stock) was $1.4bn/- in 2017, a 2.8 per cent increase from 2016.
