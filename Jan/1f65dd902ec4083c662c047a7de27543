ARUMERU’S Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) said will focus on educating petty traders (machingas) on the importance of owning special identity cards. The taxmen said they will also raise awareness of business prospects that attached with the IDs, which were issued following the president directive to formalize ‘machingas’ activities. A manager with Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) in Arumeru District, Mr Musa Sudi, said that the IDs will also enable the entrepreneurs identify other business avenues, something they couldn’t do before. “Once they own these IDs, the petty-traders will be free from any sort of harassments from city authorities and the taxman because they’ll now be responsible in paying tax to the government,” Mr Sudi said. The Arumeru District Council is set to issue more than 6,000 IDs to entrepreneurs whose business capital does not exceed 4m/-. On his part, Arusha District Executive Officer, Dr Wilson Mahela said the district council will roll out a special system of identifying entrepreneurs in the district and eventually incorporate them into the formal sector. Mid last month, President John Magufuli presented 25,000 such cards to each regional commissioner for distribution. During the event, he said that once equipped with the special ID cards, the holders will be formally recognized by the taxman at their operational centres.
