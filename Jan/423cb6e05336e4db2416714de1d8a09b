Tanzania International Container Terminal Services (TICTS) has achieved a new record annual containers throughput of 592,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in 2018 compared to 501,690 TEUs in 2017 due to increase of local and transit traffic. TICTS Chief Executive Officer, Jared Zerbe said in Dar es Salaam yesterday that the volume of local and transit traffic handled by TICTS at the Dar es Salaam port grew by 18 per cent in the year under review. “The assistance and cooperation received from the government, Tanzania Port Authority (TPA), Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA), staff, customers using the port have been the source of TICTS growth in 2018,” he said. He said transit cargo for all countries on average increased by more than 38.9 per cent year on year in 2018. The largest volume of cargo was from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) by 57 per cent followed by Zambia by 37 per cent. “I am proud of the TICTS team that has worked together to meet the challenge of strong growth in cargo handling,” he added. Mr Zerbe said TICTS achieved monthly record throughput of 54,447 TEUs in August and a monthly record of 31,239 gate moves was also handled in March 2018. He said the increase in cargo requires expedited efficiency in clearance just after discharge to reduce dwell time. This enables TICTS and the Port to increase efficiency and capacity in handling more cargo. He said to increase efficiency in handling the rising volumes, TICTS will continue working with all stakeholders including government, TPA, TRA and customers to address all challenges affecting cargo clearance at the Dar port.
