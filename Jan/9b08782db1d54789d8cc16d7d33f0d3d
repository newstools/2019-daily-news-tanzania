A team of scholars and students from the US-based Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have joined their colleagues of Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology (DIT) and the State University of Zanzibar (SUZA) to equip Tanzanians with knowledge and skills in information and communication technologies (ICT) for development, human-centred design and digital media. A joint press statement made available to the ‘Daily News’ on Tuesday said a-two week workshop from January 7-18, 2019 at DIT premises aimed at equipping trainees with creative and entrepreneurial skills that could prepare them for self-employment and support government’s initiative of industrialisation. “Tanzanian students currently have access to a computer science curriculum, but given the demand of such a curriculum there is little time to think analytically or entrepreneurially about socioeconomic impacts and development potential for ICT,” said MIT senior lecturer, Prof Lisa Parks. Before conducting the workshop, the MIT team met with Tanzanian educators and students to better understand their needs and goals.
