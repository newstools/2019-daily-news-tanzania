Dairy Farmers in Morogoro Municipality are struggling to find market for their milk as excess supply has met low demand despite shortage of the product in the country. Secretary of the dairy farmers association in Morogoro (UWAMAMO), Martha Mawanja told the ‘Daily News’ that apart from reducing price to attract more customers, it was still difficult for them to sell all the stock they have. “Formally we used to sell one litre of fresh milk at 1,500/- but we had to reduce the price to 1,300/- because we remained with large unsold stock. However despite the price reduction our members still return home with their milk because we don’t get enough customers,” she said. According to Tanzania Diary Development Board (TDB) milk consumption per capita in Tanzania is 47 litres compared to international standards of 200 litres. TDB cites that some of the challenges include value chain in the country that is leading in highest number of cattle domesticating in Africa after Ethiopia and South Sudan. Ms Mawanja said lack of processing technology was the main impediment in marketing their milk products away from Morogoro town to other places in the country. They currently refrigerate the milk and send it to Dar es Salaam where orders are as well still low. “We end up giving out for free our milk to neighbours as the market available is less than 40 percent of the total production,” she says. On possible reasons for milk market problem Ms Mawanja said that it might be due to poor quality of milk from grazers whom have invaded the region from different parts of the country. “Some animal keepers don’t adhere to health standards, some mix milk with water, but for UWAMAMO, we make sure that all important recommended standards are followed but still we struggle for market of this precious product,” she said.
