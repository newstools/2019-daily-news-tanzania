A NEW era is expected to descend upon youth football coaches as Leipzig Experts for Global Sports will run a six-day course from February 8th to 14th this year in Dar es Salaam. The German based university has since teamed up with Denmark player Yussuf Poulsen, who together will work abreast to ensure that the project accomplishes its main goal of training as many youth football coaches as possible in the country. Poulsen whose late father is a Tanzanian, plays for RB Leipzig side from German and scored the winning goal in Denmark’s 1-0 win over Peru during the last year’s World Cup edition in Russia. Confirming this to the ‘Daily News’ was Magnet Youth Sports Organisation Chairman Tuntufye Mwambusi who described the training as timely bearing in mind that the country lacks adequate and qualified youth coaches. “We have coaches but most of them are senior football coaches who encounter problems when given the chance to upgrade youth skills. I strongly believe that those who will get the chance to take part in the training will acquire vital skills needed for development of youth footballers,” Mwambusi said. According to the letter signed by Leipzig Experts for Global Sports Chairman Daniel Eckert-Lindhammer, the goals of the project include training of 25 coaches from different football academies in the city, conducting training sessions for approximately 120 children (8 to 15 years old) and carry out open training sessions for private and public Primary Schools targeting 50 children in each case. Also, according to Lindhammer, the incoming team of two football experts and one interpreter would hold meetings with representatives from the Ministry of Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, the Faculty of Sports Science at the University of Dar es Salaam aimed at discussing about long-term continuation of the project and development of sports infrastructure in general.
