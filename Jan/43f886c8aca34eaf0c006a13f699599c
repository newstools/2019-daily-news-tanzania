DIFFERENT non-governmental organisations and representatives of some pastoralist groups have hailed President John Magufuli’s stance over the eviction of pastoralists from reserved forests or wildlife parks. At the State House on Wednesday, the President remarked that he wasn’t pleased to see pastoralists removed from wherever they go for grazing. “By using the same Land Management Act, if there is a park that currently has no wild animals, let’s give part of it to pastoralists or farmers to conduct their activities,” he stated. In the wake of President’s statement, non-governmental organisations advocating for the rights of pastoralists in the country and some representatives of livestock keepers from different districts of Arusha Region commended the President, saying for a long time they were crying foul over the forceful evictions. In their statement, the latter said in many parts of the country, villages are near to the national parks, and the pastoralists have been good neighbours. Reading the statement, the Chairman of the Livestock Keepers Association, Mr George Bajuta, alleged that sometimes the evictions were conducted unfairly. “We have gathered here with mutual intent of praising the President for noticing the harassment done to pastoralists whose villages surround national parks,” he said. The latter also supported the President’s directive to embrace transparency in the exercise of demarcating the land, in the areas where the villages surround the national parks. “We agree with the President for ordering that the exercise be conducted in a month’s time…This will relieve the pastoralists of sufferings they faced for a long time,” he added. The groups also called upon the citizens in those areas to accord cooperation during the land demarcation exercise and asked the pastoralists not to intrude national parks and reserved forests, instead, they should remain in their lands of origin.
