CRDB Bank has set a goal to have a branch in every district in the next three years. The bank current has 265 branches across the country but some cities and municipals have more branches than district councils. The CRDB Chairman, Mr Ally Laay, said they want to close the gap that customers walk to access financial services. “Our goal is to reach all districts across the country by the year 2022,” Mr Laay said during the opening of the bank branch in Ruangwa district, Lindi. The chairman said in Ruangwa some customers are walking 60 to 100 kilometres to access bank services. “This is not a good picture we are doing every possible means to bridge the gap,” Mr Laay said. Ruangwa District Commissioner, Hashim Mgandilwa said they faced a number of financial challenges but inclusion tops the list. “People are walking a long distance to reach banks, please open more branches,” Mr Mgandilwa said. The CRDB Managing Director, Abdulmajid Nsekela said they would explore the possibility of opening either branches or agencies in wards to increase financial inclusion. “We will reach those in peripheral using alternative techniques… “I have passed some of these small towns which are growing up fast and certainly need financial services,” Mr Nsekela said. The alternative methods are FahariHuduma, SimBanking and SimAccount. The FahariHuduma at the end of last week had 4,286 agents. Also CRDB Microfinance has 480 micro-institutions. Over the years, CRDB Bank has grown to become the most innovative and preferred financial services partner in the region. The bank, formerly Cooperative and Rural Development Bank, was privatized in 1996. The bank, listed on Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange, mission is to provide competitive and innovative financial solutions through digital transformation to achieve distinctive customer experience.
