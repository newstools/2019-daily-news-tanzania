Football Referees Association of Tanzania (FRAT) in Arusha region has planned to conduct early stage training to referees at Sheikh Amri Abeid Stadium in the city. A regional trainer, Samweli Mpenzu, said here yesterday that the training will be conducted by chief trainer with Tanzania Football Federation (TFF), Soudy Abdi along with the former. He said there will be different groups in the training, one consisting of youth who wish to become referees; stakeholders, spectators and journalists who wish to know the rules governing football. He insisted on sport writers to come up for training as it would be helpful in their jobs. “Referees in Arusha region are now in a good condition as the region stands second in number of many referees in all leagues in the country after Dar es Salaam. It is a success that we are so much proud of and we want sustainability so that is why we train more youth,” he said, adding that all stakeholders are welcome and there will be a class in Karatu District as well. Mpenzu said there was a challenge in women participation, calling upon them to participate and that their cost would be cut to half as a means to see more joining the training. He said the training would be helpful and the result would be leaders and journalists stop wrong advocacy for players or teams that break football rules. He said other objectives of the training are to get new referees for lower leagues in district and regional levels as well as new coaches who will be teaching their players the rules. Already more than 50 stakeholders from the Northern Zone regions have indicated their willingness to participate.
