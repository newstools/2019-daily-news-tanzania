Tanzania Livestock Research Institute (Taliri) has clarified recent media reports on a donation of 3,676 chicken egg incubators to 135 villages, saying it was the dissemination of new technologies to households to facilitate agricultural activities. Taliri Director-General, Dr Eligy Shirima, clarified to reporters yesterday, saying Taliri had disseminated 27 types of new technologies to 3,676 households in 135 villages in the country for the past year. According to Taliri, the information was erroneously quoted, while briefing Minister for Livestock and Fisheries Development, Luhaga Mpina during his recent tour of Taliri in Dodoma. “During the tour, I presented a special report on a number of interventions we conducted for the past year,” he noted. Dr Shirima said further that his report focused on 27 types of technologies that the institute had disseminated and trained through its outreach programme, saying 3,676 households in 135 villages had benefited from the programme. He pointed out that the new technologies included facilitating production of pasture and forages, harvesting and pasture conservation. Dr Shirima added that other technologies disseminated to programme beneficiaries were facilitating milk and meat processing and livestock fattening. “We also empowered communities with key technologies on improved livestock production like cattle, goats, pigs and chickens and improved pasture and forage production for livestock feeding,” he said. Moreover, Dr Shirima said the institute would continue conducting research projects to improve the agricultural sector in the country, as it played a significant role in economic development. He stressed a need for journalists to seek clarification from Taliri on any technical terms.
