FEW psychiatric patients are seeking treatment at the Rukwa regional referral hospital in Sumbawanga town, as a result of which the facility is virtually a white elephant. The 20-bed hospital was built five years ago, but only two patients were admitted there for a year, at most. The Principal medical officer in charge, Dr John Lawi, told the ‘Daily News’ in an exclusive interview yesterday: “ This modern facility is vacant for the greater part of the year. We receive one or two patients only, while it has the capacity to handle twenty patients at a go.” He explained that plans were in the pipeline to convert it into a maternity wing. “On average, 20 babies are delivered here a day, but due to space limitations, overcrowding and resultant inconveniences, are commonplace,” he said. The hospital matron, Ms Veronica Kapufi, said more than two mothers were compelled to share a single bed.
