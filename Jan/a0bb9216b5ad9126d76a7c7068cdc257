NMB bank has donated iron sheets, desks and laboratory equipment to primary and secondary schools in Ileje and Momba districts in Songwe Region to support efforts in improving education in the region. The bank donated 50 desks to Nyerere Primary School and 184 laboratory stools to Ileje and Kafule Secondary Schools in Ileje District. Momba District Commissioner, Jumaa Irando said Tunduma is one of the fast growing urban areas due to a rapid growing population that is overwhelming public institutions including schools. He said that the urban growth had became a challenge particularly in schools and the NMB support would be most welcome. “For sure we have a great challenge here in Tunduma, there is a growing number of children for enrolling in Standard One every year beyond our projections." Ileje District Commissioner (DC), Joseph Mkude thanked NMB for the support to schools saying it was an indication that the bank valued the people particularly those living in remote parts of the country. “I thank NMB to have heeded our call for the laboratory seating stools, and desks, which are important to us. We promise to put them in good care for long term use,” he said. NMB Highland Zone, Straton Chilongola said his institution recognizes the importance of education and health for Tanzanians, hence in this year, the bank has earmarked 1bn/- as contributions to support.
