Serengeti Breweries Limited (SBL) has commenced its responsible drinking campaign among students at St. Augustine University of Tanzania (SAUT) in Mwanza Region seeking to raise awareness against irresponsible consumption of liquor among students in various institutions of higher learning in the country. “Responsible drinking means more than just limiting yourself to a certain number of drinks; it also means not getting drunk and not letting alcohol control your life or your relationships,” SBL Corporate Relations Director, John Wanyancha told SAUT students gathered at the Nyegezi campus. He said SBL campaign aims at sensitizing the student fraternity that irresponsible drinking affects more than an individual and can destroy everything in its path, be it academics, friendship and even relationships. “Understanding all the risks and staying aware of the risks associated with excessive alcohol consumption and the long-term repercussions thereof, are the hallmarks of a responsible drinking,” he said. The brewer’s social intervention at SAUT comes alongside the ‘Don’t Drink and Drive’ Campaign launched in Mwanza Region in Friday aimed to create awareness on the dangers of irresponsible drinking among drivers and other road users for the safety of the community. Speaking during the launch of the campaig Mwanza Regional Traffic Officer, Mkaddam Hamis Mkaddam, said that by involving the police force in the campaign, SBL had set the pace in supporting the government in creating awareness on the dangers of irresponsible drinking and created a forum on how to curb the menace. Mkaddam noted that a section of the population, especially the drivers, consume alcohol excessively without considering the repercussions caused by their actions, cautioning that such negligence could lead to fatal accidents.
