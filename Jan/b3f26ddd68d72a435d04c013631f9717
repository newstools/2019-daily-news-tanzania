FARAJA Damas and Failuna Matanga, both from the National Service (JKT), were the top stars of the maiden Mirerani-Tanzanite Marathon held yesterday in Simanjiro, Manyara region. Faraja who clocked 1 hour and 14 seconds emerged the winner of the men’s 21km Half Marathon. Hot on his heels was Michael Joseph all the way from Singida who finished the race in 1 hour and 34 seconds, while Stephano Huche came in third, clocking 1 hour, 1 minute and 27 seconds. For the female runners, it was Failuna Matanga who won the event after spending 1 hour, 9 minutes and 36 seconds. The women’s category runner up prize went to Angelina Daniel who spent 1 hour, 14 minutes and 20 seconds, while the third-placed finisher was Rosalia Fabiano, all from the National Service (JKT). Gracing the event was the Deputy Information, Culture and Sports Minister, Juliana Shonza, who lauded the organisers for staging a successful event despite being their first time to organise the event of the national caliber. “Usually the inaugural event proves to be hard, cumbersome and sometimes an event fails, but for the Maiden Mirerani-Tanzanite Marathon, this is a runaway success,” she said, insisting that, the sporting event should continue to reflect what President Magufuli is currently doing; safeguarding the country’s mineral resources. On his part, the Chief Organiser of Mirerani Marathon, Charles Mnyalu said the event aims at promoting the rare blue Tanzanite Gemstones, internationally and that for starters the race has attracted four runners from Kenya, but they failed to participate after being late to process permits. Winners of the maiden Mirerani-Tanzanite Marathon were awarded with cash prizes as well as medals. However, the young athletes who participated in the children category of the race, got school equipment.
