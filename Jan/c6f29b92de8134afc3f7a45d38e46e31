ABOUT 25 villages in Zanzibar and Tanzania Mainland are set to benefit from 1.2trl/- in water projects, which are expected to take off from July, this year. That was revealed at the Indian High Commission in Dar es Salaam recently by Minister for Water and Irrigation, Prof Makame Mbarawa in a speech, while presiding over a celebration to mark the 70th anniversary of the Republic of India in presence in Tanzania. “The project is expected to take-off from July, this year and the government has already secured the project’s funds through a soft loan from the government of India,” pointed out the Minister. Prof Mbarawa further said the completion of the said mega project was in line with the implementation of the ruling party’s (CCM) 2015 election manifesto, which focuses on ensuring that 95 per cent of water supply reaches all the regions’ capital towns, and 90 per cent capital towns as well as 80 per cent available in all villages by 2020. The Minister added that the country has been a close friend of Tanzanians and that it has continued to also offer unconditional support to Tanzania in various sectors. “Such support included the improvement of Dar es Salaam and Chalinze water project that was completed in June 2017; the ongoing extension of Lake Victoria Pipeline project to Tabora Region; the ongoing provision of clean and safe water project targeting 17 towns in Tanzania Mainland and the rehabilitation of the water supply system in Zanzibar to mention but a few,” he said. The minister further noted that in addition to the water projects, Tanzania was one of the major beneficiaries of quality education scholarships and training opportunities graciously funded by India through the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) and Special Commonwealth Assistance for Africa (SCAAP) programmes. Expounding, he said many Tanzanian professionals in the fields of health, security, academia, service, accounts, and engineering are products of Indian pedagogical support.
