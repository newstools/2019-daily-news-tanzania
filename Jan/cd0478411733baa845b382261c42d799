Doing less sitting and more moving is tied to living longer, a new study in the United States (USA) has revealed. Replacing 30 minutes per day of sedentary time with 30 minutes of physical activity at a light intensity was associated with a 17% lower risk of early death in a study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology on Monday. The study also found that replacing 30 minutes of inactive time with 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise was associated with a 35% lower risk of early death. A certified exercise physiologist and assistant professor of behavioral medicine at Columbia University Medical Center in New York Keith Diaz said "If you replace 30 minutes of sitting time with 30 minutes of light-intensity physical activity like a casual stroll down the hall, still can lower your risk," The researchers found that replacing sitting time with exercise and movement was associated with a benefit, but replacing prolonged periods of sitting with shorter periods of sitting was not.
