SECOND Vice-President Seif Ali Iddi has launched Zanzibar Anti-Corruption Strategy Coordination Committee (ZACSCC) with a call on members of the public to join forces against corruption, which hampers achieving development goals. “Despite ongoing efforts, corruption remains a big challenge. We need to work together to win or minimise the incidence of corruption,” Mr Iddi said during a brief ceremony to launch ZACSCC at his office along Vuga Street. He said people should understand that corruption impeded development efforts, with consequent effects on job availability,” he said, adding that achieving sustainable development began with fighting against corruption. Mr Iddi said further that achieving development goals, included eradicating poverty, ensuring better health care, education, clean water and energy, among others, stressing that these had been delayed because of corruption. Anti-Corruption Strategy Inter-Agency Coordination Committee (ACSICC) was formed and launched last year and will continue operating under the guidance of ZACSCC. “The main objective of the committees is to combat corruption in Zanzibar,” he said. Both committees will operate under the Zanzibar Anti- Corruption and Economic Crime Authority (ZAECA) established in 2011 by the Zanzibar government to fight against corruption and related crimes in the Islands. ZAECA public relations and communication officer, Mwanaidi Suleiman said the launch of ZACSCC was another milestone in the anti-corruption campaign, which required every citizen to play a role in making Zanzibar a corruption free country.
