It has been reported that the un-crewed Chang'e-4 probe touched down in the South Pole-Aitken Basin at 10:26 Beijing time (02:26 GMT).

The landing is being seen as a major milestone in space exploration.” Labeled Chang'e-4, the robotic has already sent back its first pictures from the surface which were shared by state media.
