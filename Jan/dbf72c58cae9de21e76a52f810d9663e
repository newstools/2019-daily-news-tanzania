LEPAJE Environmental Organisation has launched a campaign to plant trees capable of yielding fruits on cemeteries, which goes in line with a motto of ‘turning the dead into fruits’. The campaign, which is a long-term programme to address environmental degradation also in the country, was launched at Kifuni Juu village in Moshi Rural District, where the organisation has its offices. In the scheme, the members started by planting 200 seedlings of avocado trees in five cemeteries, as a demonstration before moving to other cemeteries. Mr Leonard Massawe, the Executive Director of Lepaje said in the village, they decided to plant such trees whose fruits would be ready for consumption just after a year. “In this cold climate zone we decided to plant this fruittree as it thrives well with favourite fruits in the community. We have used high breed, and the new planting scheme requires good and close cooperation with government, media, religious leaders, academic institutions and the general community,” he pointed out. Mr Massawe further said that the five cemeteries they picked up for demonstration purposes were registered as three of his family members namely his mother and two brothers, adding that “charity must begin at home as a simple way to motivate others for them to achieve their goals.” “Mobilisation of communities on planting fruit trees on cemeteries is highly needed, and I have planted a fruit tree on my mother’s grave… she would become a seed of conservation and environmental care in the world,” he hinted.
