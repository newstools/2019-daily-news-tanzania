President John Magufuli has warned District Commissioners who are misusing their power to punish people by ordering their arrest. President Magufuli addressed the issue during the swearing-in ceremony of the officials including judges and District Commissioners (DCs) he appointed recently, at the State House in Dar es Salaam, early Tuesday. He said some DCs have misused their powers to order random arrest of some people including officials, on cases that needed no police attention and could be solved through conversation and directives. “Don’t take advantage of the authority you have by arresting people randomly without cause; some issues can be solved without anyone being remanded,” he noted. Furthermore, President Magufuli commended all judges who perform their duties diligently, especially the elderly, adding that they deserve promotion, even if they’re about to retire. “There are judges who are about to retire but are performing well; why not promote them ahead of young people who are performing poorly?” he queried.
