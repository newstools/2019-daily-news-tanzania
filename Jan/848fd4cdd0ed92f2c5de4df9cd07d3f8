WATER and Irrigation Deputy Minister Jumaa Aweso yesterday detained Monduli district water engineer and contractor for poor service delivery on a 1.79bn/ project in the district. The visibly irate deputy minister directed the Monduli Officer Commanding District to have Mr Charles Saidea from Monduli District Council and Mr Jeremiah Ayo, a contractor from Mero contractors Limited, arrested and detained for derailing the project and delaying development to Monduli residents. Mr Aweso, who was on field visit in Lekindinya Ward in Monduli District accused the two of laying plastic pipes instead of steel pipes in trenches that led to a water reservoir constructed in the ward. The deputy minister pointed an accusing figure at the two individuals for lying to the villagers on the progress of the water project, while they had already been paid by the district. “You’ve clearly demonstrated to us how unprofessional you are, you deserve to be locked for a night as you sort out your mess,” said the deputy minister. The furious minister initially directed Mr Ayo to apologise before the villagers for denying them water services, before he visited the trenches to verify. “This is unacceptable, we cannot tolerate such carelessness,” he noted. Mr Aweso said the engineer and the contractor had earlier lied to him about the progress of the work. While briefing the deputy minister, Mr Saidea said the project was about to be completed. Such assurance compelled the deputy minister to visit the project site only to witness the shoddy work done by the two individuals. “You cannot tell me that the project is at 85 per cent, when the people of this ward walk long distances in search of water,” wondered the deputy minister.
