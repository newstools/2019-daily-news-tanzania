TANZANIA Fertiliser Regulatory Authority (TFRA) Executive Director Lazaro Kitandu and three other officials have been suspended, accused of consenting export of locally produced fertilisers amid shortages in the domestic market. In the meantime, a team of six experts led by Dr Wilhelmina Mafuru has been formed to assess availability of fertilisers to farmers. Agriculture Minister Japhet Hasunga made the revelation while addressing reporters here, yesterday. The minister said TFRA had earlier reported that imported fertilisers did not meet the country’s demand of 514,146 tonnes. He said only 437,910 tonnes of fertilisers were imported, with 323,586 tonnes already having distributed to various regions and 182,674 tonnes sold to farmers. “While the available fertilisers can’t meet the demand, our colleagues in TFRA issued permit for sale of fertilisers to the neighbouring Zambia. They issued the permit without even seeking approval from the minister or permanent secretary,” charged Mr Hasunga. He added: “As I speak, three vehicles are held at Tunduma border with 60 tonnes of fertilisers destined for Zambia.” At least 114,000 tonnes of fertilisers, which were supposed to be distributed to upcountry regions, remain in Dar es Salaam. The minister threatened stern measures against irresponsible government officials behind the failure to transport the fertilisers. On other hand, Mr Hasunga denounced people who failed to repay the loans they took from the cooperative unions. The defaulters owe the cooperatives countrywide about 6.8bn/-, which weakens the unions’ operations. “I have a list of all societies countrywide and their defaulters. They should repay the loans immediately before legal measures are taken against them,” he stated. He warned people bent on taking properties of the cooperative societies, reminding them to return them within a three-month ultimatum he had issued recently.
