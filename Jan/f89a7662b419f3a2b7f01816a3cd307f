PRESIDENT Ali Mohamed Shein yesterday inaugurated a new primary school in Chimba Micheweni village in North Pemba, with an appeal to members of the public to support ongoing reforms in education, including implementation of the free education policy. Parents thanked the government for establishing a school in the village, which previously had none. One of them, Ms Fatma Kombo, remarked: “Our children previously walked for a long distance to school. This turn of events has delighted us tremendously.” Dr Shein said he was pleased with the progress that had been recorded in the free education policy from nursery to secondary levels. He reiterated that the government gave the education sector top priority, saying it was improper for parents to be asked to buy items like brooms or chalk. “The government is doing a lot to ensure that children enjoy free education. We provide all basic requirements, but it is crucial for members of the public who include parents and teachers, to support the initiative by encouraging children to attend school, work hard in studies and curb immoral behaviour,” Dr Shein said. The event attended by the Minister for Education and Vocational Training, Ms Riziki Pembe Juma, was part of activities to mark the 55th anniversary of the Zanzibar revolution climaxing on January 12. President John Magufuli will be the guest of honour at the event which will be held at Gombani Stadium in Pemba. Dr Shein said the 7.7 percent economic growth was a clear indication that the government was successfully implementing the free education and healthcare policies. He directed the education ministry to solve the shortage of teachers at Chimba Primary School as soon as possible. Dr Shein said: “We need quality education in order to produce qualified graduates who would render exemplary services in various fields.”
