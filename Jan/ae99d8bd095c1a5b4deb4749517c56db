SELCOM has launched a new platform that allows customers to make interbank fund transfers, in real-time, through the various digital access channels available countrywide. The new platform, dubbed `Qwiksend’, has been launched in collaboration with Business Connexion (BCX). Speaking to journalists yesterday in Dar es Salaam, Executive Director of Selcom, Sameer Hirji said their goal has always been to further financial inclusion in Tanzania and the launch of interbank transfers brings us one step closer to achieving that goal. “Not only will interbank transfers open up a new avenue of funds transfers, but it will also enable smoother transactions that are cost effective for individuals, and small-scale merchants alike,” Sameer said. As of now, interbank transfers involves the traditional physical withdrawal and deposit or alternatively, the mobile transfer route which involves the loading of funds into one’s mobile wallet and then deposit into the beneficiary’s bank account. These routes are tedious and costly to the customer, denying the consumer the benefits of real-time transactions,” he said. He added that Qwiksend service eliminates the double-charging effect and only charges the sender once, on sending funds. Since the Qwiksend service is managed by Selcom/BCX end-to-end, the service is quick, real-time and reliable. The charges associated with Qwiksend will be significantly cheaper than the current charges of existing transfer options in the market. “Qwiksend is fully operational and is expected to have over 20 participating banks by the end of March 2019 with the number expected to grow to 40 banks by the end of June 2019. Participation is through open banking Application Programme Interfaces (“APIs”) and settlement is handled by way of existing net-off settlement processes
