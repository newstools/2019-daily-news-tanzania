THE minimum compensation rates for people injured in accidents will start being implemented in March this year, the Tanzania Insurance Regulatory Authority (TIRA) has revealed. They will go hand in hand with among others, the amount of compensation that an insurer should offer to a victim, in line with the scope of damage. TIRA Commissioner, Dr Baghayo Saqware (pictured) affirmed that the process to introduce the rates was in final stages, since the Authority has already set the rates which are supposed to be reviewed by Certified Actuaries. However, he wasn’t ready to reveal the proposed minimum rates until Certified Actuaries are done. “Also, the procurement process has already begun and it is our belief that by end of March, everything will be concluded by involving all stakeholders and getting approvals. Stakeholders’ comments and approvals are important to make sure that each side (insurer and victim) benefit,” he noted. It was noted that the lack of a law in this regard seemed to have been undermining casualties with insurers issuing compensation in their favour regardless of seriousness of the damage one has experienced, especially loss of productive organs, such as legs, arms, eyes, fingers among others. He added that before the law to govern the rates goes into practice, stakeholders have to comment and approve the minimum amount to be contributed by vehicle owners, so as to give power for insurers to issue standard compensation for any damage. Discussing the amount was mostly triggered by bodabodas, which in most cases are involved in road accidents, while owners pay little for insurance cover and let insurers fail to compensate serious damages. On the other side, Dr Saqware revealed that the Authority’s priorities for 2019, was much concerned with improvement in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) system, and to develop the market and insurance penetration.
