Dar Es Salaam Stock Exchange posted a slight bearish week, losing 0.73 percent on domestic capitalization. By the end of last week domestic market capitalization was TZS 9,495.66 billion ($4.14 billion) compared to previous week’s TZS 9,564.87 billion ($4.17 billion) leading to the Tanzania Share Index (TSI) losing 26.35 points to close the week at 3,615.04 points. The bearish week was a result of fallen prices on TBL and CRDB despite an increase on DSE counter. TBL price dropped to 12,400/- from previous week’s 12,600/- after trading 239,761 shares generating a turnover of 2.976bn/- ($1.3 million) accounting for 87.1 per cent of the total market equity turnover. CRDB dropped to 135/- from previous week’s 140/- after moving 1,899,818 shares generating a turnover of 256.9m/- ($0.11 million). DSE closed the week at a price of 1,320/- from previous week’s 1,200/- with volume of 14,251 shares traded during the week generating a turnover of 18.77m/- ($0.0082 million). Total equity turnover dropped by 66.71 per cent during the week to a total amount of 3.4bn/- ($1.49 million) from previous week’s 10.27bn/- ($4.48 million). Same as most weeks, TBL accounted for a lion share of 87.1 per cent of the total equity turnover. Foreign investors accounted for 86.86 per cent and 90.42 per cent of investments and divestments into and from the market respectively. However, total market capitalization gained 2.23 per cent to close the week with a total capitalization of TZS 19,802.74 billion ($8.63 billion) from previous week’s TZS 19,370.97 billion ($8.44 billion). Consequentially, the All Share Index (DSEI) gained 44.79 points to close the week at 2,054.45 points. The gain in total market capitalization is a result of price appreciation in cross listed counters despite domestic price depreciation. Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange was finally approved to a full membership of the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) following an on-site peer review and inspection exercises carried out by a team comprised of representatives from Johannesburg Stock Exchange, Egypt Stock Exchange and Bermuda Stock Exchange in December 2018. “This evaluation confirmed that the Stock Exchange, Regulations, the Central Depository and other stakeholders (including listed companies, stockbrokers, custodians and settlement banks, etc) of the Tanzanian capital market meet the main WFE standards and requirements in terms of compliance with market principles, efficiency and governance issues” reads part of an official statement from the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange. Approval to the WFE is a good thing for the Exchange since it will increase visibility to international investors and fund managers. On the other hand, FTSE Russell has approved the addition of Tanzania to “FTSE Watch List” for possible reclassification from Unclassified to Frontier Market Status by September 2019. The reclassification will be a further attractiveness and show of trust to international investors making the Dar bourse a lucrative investments destination. Money Market, Bills and Bonds Volume transactions in the Interbank Money Market (IMM) increased by 35.3 percent during the week to post a total of TZS 138.3 billion ($60.28 million) compared to last week’s TZS 103.2 billion ($44.98 million). Volume transactions rose parallel to the interbank weighted average rate which closed the week at 3.78 percent compared to previous week’s 3.65 percent. Interbank weighted average rate has been increasing since September 2018 when it averaged below 2 percent. Increased interbank rates signals tightening liquidity in the banking sector.

Number of bids increased as well, from 102 bids in the previous auction to current 141 bids.Tenors of 35 days and 91 days received a single bid each and were both rejected while majority of the funds targeted the 364 days tenor. The Bank accepted TZS 148 billion ($64.5 million) which is 4.96 per cent higher than the offer size and 21 percent less than the tender size. The total weighted average yield to maturity (WAYTM) gained 31bps compared to the previous Treasury bills auction conducted on the 9th January 2019. WAYTM during the auction under review was 8.69 per cent compared to previous auction’s 8.38 percent. Currency Market Total amount traded in the Interbank Foreign Exchange Market (IFEM) is also still increasing although it is still below $1 million daily average. Total amount traded during the week was $4 million which is 10.5 per cent higher than previous week’s $3.62 million. The shilling remained fairly stable during the week with a mere depreciation of 0.01 percent leading to a weekly final weighted average exchange rate of TZS 2,294.41/ USD compared to last week’s TZS 2,294.24/USD.
