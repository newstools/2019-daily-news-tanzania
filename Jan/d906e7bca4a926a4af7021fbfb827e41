MEMBERS of the public have been urged to invest in kids by supporting ‘sports academy’ should they need to have best footballers and other games in future. The call was made here by officers from Germany based NGO named ‘GOZA-Go-for Zanzibar e.v’ when presenting sports gear to the Ujamaa Kids Academy at Rahaleo Street. Antje Fleischer- Director of the NGO said her organisation is happy to continue supporting the academy, but it is important that other people in Zanzibar support the talented children to develop to best players and the country will have sports stars in the future. She handed over jerseys, balls, and sports shoes to the children in the academy that was established by the historical Ujamaa football club. It currently trains 30 young children of age between eight and 14 years. “Let us support our children and love them,” said Fleischer after handing over the sports gear worth 3.5m/-. She also donated to the children schools equipment (notes/exercise books and pens) to encourage them to study and fruits (oranges and apples) to promote good health as they grow. The donation to the academy in the past four years amount to about 12m/- and the NGO has also recently funded the painting of the Ujamaa Club as the ‘Sports Kids academy’ Project manager Mussa Khamis Mussa said “Sports help keep the children and young people away from illicit drugs and engaging in criminals groups.”
