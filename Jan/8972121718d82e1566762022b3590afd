PRESIDENT John Magufuli is today expected to officiate at the commissioning of the Telecommunications Traffic Management System (TTMS) at the Tanzania Communication Regulatory Authority (TCRA) grounds in Dar es Salaam. The System that was installed by the Société Générale De Surveillance and Global Voice Group (SGC/GVB) of Switzerland under a build operate Transfer Agreement was launched in February 2014 and it had to be transferred to TCRA for full control after five years. Addressing members of the media yesterday, TCRA Director General, Engineer James Kilaba said the system aims at monitoring the quality of services provided by mobile telecom companies in the country as well as controlling tax revenues. According to him, TTMS has been operational since October 2013 and it has already yielded tangible results like enabling the regulator to get accurate statistics on international and local communication traffic. “Through TTMS, we have been able to detect fraudulent traffic, statistics on mobile money transaction as well as the quality of services offered by telecommunication companies,” he explained. Again, it has enabled TCRA to have records of all SIM card profiles and their Central Equipment Identification Register (CEIR) as well as detecting and blocking duplicate International Mobile Equipment Identification (IMEI’s). The TCRA boss said the authority has also been able to verify revenues collected by the telecommunication companies. “The system has also enabled us to issue statistics about customers’ traffic on text messages, voice call and use of data based on telecom companies they are subscribing,” added Eng Kilaba. The system provides the regulator with the technological solutions required to measure and analyse key aspects of the sector independently, with a view of ensuring both regulatory compliance and thorough collection of levies by the government.
