TanzaniaÂ Prisons head coach Adolf Rishard has said their sole aim is to stay in the Tanzania Premier League (TPL) as the hopes for the title seem to fade. Prisons who had previously good records in the Premier League have not been going well this season, and with 16 points from 23 matches they find themselves fighting hard to escape relegation. Speaking after their 1-1 draw with Alliance FC on Tuesday at Nyamagana Stadium, Rishard said so far the fighting spirit shown by his players proved that they are capable of surviving relegation scare if they win every match ahead of them. Tanzania Prisons goal was netted by Michael Ismail in the 16th minute and the host equaliz ed through Hussein Javu after an assist in the 42nd minute. The former Villa squad and Kagera Sugar coach, Rishard said they will rectify their mistakes that led to their draw against Alliance FC. Under the Tutelage of head coach Rishard and his assistant Shabaan Kazumba, Prisons have won one match against Mtibwa Sugar whom they beat 2-0 at Sokoine Memorial stadium in Mbeya. They have drawn two matches against Coastal Union in a barren draw at the same venue before drawing again with Alliance FC at Nyamagana Stadium.
