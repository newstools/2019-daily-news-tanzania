SEVEN villages in Simiyu region’s Meatu District, through their Makao Wildlife Management Authority, have signed a five-year contract with Mwiba Holdings, a hunting firm that operates in the area. The deal essentially renews the contract, which now improves the villages’ earning from the previous 400m/- per year to 600m/, effective this year, in line with the government determination to see wananchi benefiting from conservation undertakings. Under the deal, each village stands to earn 27m/- per year instead of 25m/- that used to be gained annually through previous arrangements. During the signing ceremony at Meatu District Council, Mwiba Holdings Manager Mark Ghaul said in addition to improved revenues for the villages, his company, through the Friedkin Conservation Fund (FCF) has also donated a Toyota Land-cruiser field patrolling truck, worth 40m/- to Makao WMA to aid conservation efforts. Makao WMA Secretary Robert Simon expressed gratitude over the donation and used the occasion to announce the upcoming operation to evict trespassers who have encroached the conservation area, threatening natural growth and wild animals. “There are over 60 families with about 300 people between them, plus their livestock, that have invaded the areas under protection,” said Simon, adding that the families will be forced out of the preserved precincts. Meatu is mapped within 8835 square kilometres of land but nearly 40 per cent of it is covered by Maswa Game Reserve measuring 4223 square kilometres. Meatu, which falls under the Simiyu Region, also has part of Serengeti National Park covering 16 per cent of the District and Ngorongoro Conservation Area taking 3.3 per cent of the area. Makao WMA measuring nearly 780 square kilometres, accounts for 31.2 per cent of the total District Area, being made up of communal land contributed by seven villages including Makao itself; Ginamo; Mwabagimu; Saapa; Mwagundo; Iramba-Ndogo and Mbushi.
