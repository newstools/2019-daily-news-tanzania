Livestock keepers living near game protected areas in Serengeti District should take precautions against lions, a government game official said yesterday. “Livestock keepers near game protected areas should keep their herds of cattle from lions, lest some of them fall prey to lions,” Serengeti District Council Game Officer John Lendoyan told ‘Daily News’. The official was reacting to reports indicating that several herds of cattle were recently killed by lions in villages near game protected areas. Mr Lendoyan confirmed about six herds of cattle to have been killed by lions in recent weeks. He also urged villagers to refrain from grazing in game protected areas. “Serengeti residents are reaping the fruits of wildlife protection through investors. So, they need to continue protecting wild animals. They see the benefits of wildlife protection,” he noted. Besides Serengeti National Park, many villages of Serengeti District are located near Ikorongo/Grumeti Game Reserves and Ikona Wildlife Management Area (WMA). The game reserves and the WMA form part of the Serengeti ecosystem. Covering 242.3 square kilometres, Ikona WMA was formed by five villages several years ago. The villages are Robonda, Park-Nyigoti, Natta-Mbiso, Nyichoka and Makundusi. It is seen as the best performing WMA in the country. The WMA’s substantial revenue, which is heavily injected into community development projects, comes from Singita Grumeti. The WMA generates about 3bn/- each year, according to its officials. It is rated as the best performing WMA in the country. Meanwhile, efforts to introduce good land use plans to residents living near game protected areas are also underway in about 36 villages of the district.
