ABOUT 400 young people from Chama Cha Mapinduzi (UVCCM) tomorrow end their 48km-walk from Chokocho (Mkoani) to Gombani-ya-Kale ground (Chakechake) to mark the 55th anniversary of Zanzibar Revolution and recognise independence heroes. The youths started the journey last Saturday at Abdallah Pindua School in Mkoani, where Dr Abdallah Juma, CCM Deputy Secretary General responsible for Zanzibar commended them for maintaining the walk annually. “We need you (youths) because you’re crucial to national building and peace keeping. Promote unity during your walk for Revolution,” Dr Juma said during the launch of the walk, which attracted youths from both Mainland and Zanzibar. He said as Tanzanians celebrated the 55th anniversary of Zanzibar Revolution, “we should be proud of recorded achievements so far in various programmes such as health, education, infrastructure, agriculture, water, fisheries and sea/land transportation.” UVCCM Vice Chairperson Tabia Maulid Mwita said they had walked to honour people, who participated in the 1964 Revolution and encourage the youth to work together, engage in entrepreneurship and avoid criminal acts. She said they had been working hard to build the party as the country moved towards the 2020 General Election of which “We CCM will definitely win overwhelmingly because the majority of Tanzanians are happy with the ruling party’s performance.”
