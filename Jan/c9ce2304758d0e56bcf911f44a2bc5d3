Dr Mpango said the late Ndejembi was a believer of diligence and women empowerment ambassador as he was against all acts of corruption. Mr Ndugai expressed the late Ndejembi as a person who would make strong decisions when it comes to fairness. Giving the CCM condolence message, Mr Pinda said the party has lost one of the influential members who was committed to serve it whole heartedly. Dodoma Regional Commissioner, Dr Binilith Mahenge said Ndejembi was a wisdom tank they would rush to for consultation. The late Ndejembi served as a District Commissioner (DC) in various parts of the country, and Dodoma Region Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) Chairman for 25 years. The burial ceremony was preceded by a holy mass at Paul the Cross Parish. The late Ndejembi passed away last weekend at Dodoma Referral Hospital while undergoing treatment. According to the family, his health began to deteriorate and suddenly he collapsed in his living room at his home in Uzunguni, early last month. He was admitted several times, since then at the Benjamin Mkapa Hospital and Dodoma Christian Medical Centre (DCMC). Recently his health worsened and they had to rush him to Dodoma Referral Hospital, where he passed away. He would be remembered for championing the move to make Dodoma the capital city of the country in remembrance of Julius Nyerere.
