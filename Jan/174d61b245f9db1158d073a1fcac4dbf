THE import and export of chemical goods, food, drugs and cosmetics through the Tanzania- Kenya Namanga border have been on an increase over the past three years. The two authorities in charge of checking the quality of those commodities attributed the rise to the current industrialisation speed and rise in compliance with the laws and regulations governing the importation and exportation of the items. Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority (TFDA) authorities at the border confirmed that the goods falling under its docket had been increasing, and the same was witnessed on the part of the Government Chemist Laboratory Authority (GCLA). According to the TFDA, a total of 3038 consignments of food, drugs and cosmetics were imported between January 2016 and December 2018, while about 1490 similar consignments were exported through the border after acquiring permits. Mr Elia Nyaula, the TFDA’s official in charge at the border, told the ‘Daily News’ that over the past three years, consignments transported across border increased significantly. According to statistics, the number of imported consignments in 2016 was 754, as well as 1061 in 2017 and 1223 in 2018. Mr Nyaula further noted that due to the country’s current industrial drive, industrial products exported through the border was also on an upward trend during the corresponding period as follows: 2016 (429), 2017 (425) and 2018 (640). “This means that trade relations between the two countries has been on the rise, and thus giving opportunities to Tanzanians,” he said. Apart from that, it shows that compliance with the import and export regulations for food, drugs and cosmetics had also increased since the traders choose the formal border across which to ferry their goods. Mr Nyaula was explaining achievements attained in the operations of the TFDA at the borders during the three years of President John Magufuli’s leadership. On the part of the GCLA, the number of chemicals importers and exporters who complied with the legal requirements had been rising. GCLA’s Officer in charge at the border, Mr Michael Benard, said the consignments complying with the laws were 750 in 2016. Figures for 2017 and 2018 were, respectively, 1120 and 1237. The compliance was at the highest level of 93 per cent last year while it was at 77.2 per cent the previous year.
