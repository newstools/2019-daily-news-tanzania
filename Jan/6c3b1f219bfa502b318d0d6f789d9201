NATIONAL Environment Management Council (NEMC) has issued a two-month ultimatum to all environmental consultancy firms to pay statutory fees or risk having their licences revoked. NEMC Director General Dr Samuel Gwamaka told reporters in Dar es Salaam recently that consultants and consultancy companies will jeopardise their work for failure to pay the specified fees in time. He said the council has put in place a monitoring schedule to follow up payment of government fees and keep track of performance of recognised consultants and consultancy companies. “They are our important stakeholders. But, they have to pay statutory fees in two months. Upon expiry of the grace period, we will make a countrywide crackdown on defaulters and revoke their licences…we may be compelled to take legal action against obstinate defaulters,” he warned. Dr Gwamaka explained that the fees, when paid timely, enable the council to discharge well its duties, including giving advice to environmental stakeholders and inspecting project sites. He reminded consultants, consultancy companies and institutions that have Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) certificates to observe the law. The DG asked those without certificates to visit NEMC offices in Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Dodoma, Mbeya, Mtwara and Mwanza for consultations and pieces of advice on their projects. Eastern Zonal Coordinator Jaffari Chimgege said NEMC officials will be visiting sites in Dar es Salaam, Tanga, Morogoro and Coast to see whether or not holders of EIA certificates are complying with the prescribed requirements. He explained that NEMC has registered 1000 environment consultants and 200 consultancy firms to offer NEMC services countrywide.
