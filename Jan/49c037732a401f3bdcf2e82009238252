INSPECTOR General of Police Simon Sirro yesterday transferred Regional Police Commanders (RPCs) for Arusha, Temeke and Ilala, SACP Ramadhani Ng’anzi, ACP Emmanuel Lukula and ACP Salum Hamdun, to the Police headquarters. According to a statement issued by Police Force in Dar es Salaam yesterday, the move was intended to pave the way for thorough investigations into allegations levelled at the officers by the Home Affairs Minister, Mr Kangi Lugola. According to the statement, replacements of the officers would be made soon. On the 15th of this month, Minister Lugola revoked their appointments, citing misconduct, including corruption and negligence as the main reasons. He further accused them of condoning illegal business dealers and protecting illicit drug dealers. He said that Ilala and Temeke RPCs had been disregarding orders against corruption as well as escorting criminals and condoning illegal businesses. At a press conference in Dodoma, the minister was quoted as saying: “As the Home Affairs Minister, I am responsible for supervision of all these...I have sacked these officers but the replacement exercise is up to the Inspector General Police.”
