AN agriculturist has called for the establishment of a feedlot outside the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) in a bid to strike the right balance between wildlife conservation and people’s livelihoods. He opined that once the feedlot becomes operational, it will increase off take rate and eventually provide quality meat to pastoralists. “The essence of having a feedlot is to increase the amount of meat each animal produces as quickly as possible; if animals are kept in confined quarters rather than being allowed to range freely over grassland, they will put on weight more quickly,” observed Professor Sharadhuli Iddi Kimera from Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA), while addressing Ngorongoro Pastoral Council (NPC) midweek. Professor Kimera, who was speaking at a conference aimed at improving livestock production for communities in the NCA, pointed out that the establishment of such a facility would enable pastoral communities living in the area improve their livestock production. “The biggest advantage in feedlots is that they are the most economical way to raise a large number of cattle for beef production,” he said. The University don also stressed on the importance of breed improvement in the NCA, encouraging the formation of cooperatives breeding groups for cattle, sheep and goats in the area. Earlier on, Deputy Commissioner of Conservation with the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority (NCAA), Dr Maurus Msuha said the pastoral communities in the area were still grappling with a myriad of challenges such as invasive species, shortage of water sources, population pressure and the scramble for pasture between wild animals and livestock. “We need to have a clear strategy if we are to overcome these challenges,” he said. The NCAA official was optimistic that experts from SUA will help the pastoral communities acknowledge the challenges that come with keeping large herds of cattle to the environment and in competing with wild animals for pasture.
