JAKAYA Kikwete Cardiac Institute (JKCI) topped the list of Africa’s cardiac hospitals last year with the highest number of heart surgeries. JKCI Executive Director Dr Mohamed Janabi said in Dar es Salaam yesterday that the institute performed 1,356 heart operations last year, the record high among all cardiac facilities in the continent. He was briefing Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children Minister Ummy Mwalimu during her visit to the institute to inspect the newly constructed ward for children. Dr Janabi pointed out that this year the institute plans to further improve the services and serve more patients within and outside the country. “Apart from performing the highest number of surgeries, the institute has managed to meet the World Health Organisation (WHO) standards on the number of deaths of heart patients. WHO death ceiling is 13 per cent, but at JKCI only five per cent of patients died while receiving treatment,” said Dr Janabi. He said construction of the new ward for minors has added more value to JKCI, making the institute the only cardiac facility in East and Central Africa with special section for the treatment of children suffering from heart diseases. In some countries children share wards with adults, something which is medically improper, he said. Construction of the juvenile ward has been supported by the Baps Charities Institute. Minister Mwalimu said because of the good work that JKCI has performed, President John Magufuli has provided 500m/- for the institute to realise its improvement plans. The institute has been operating 20 children with heart diseases daily and the construction of the new ward will enable it to operate about 40 children. The minister hinted that the government is considering extending the cardiac services to Mloganzila hospital. Executive Director of Save a Child Heart organisation Simon Fisher said his organisation will continue helping children who suffer from heart diseases in the country.
