NMB bank has handed over various items to Mbeya schools worth over 25m/- to support government efforts in improving learning environment. “We recognise challenges in the education sector and as NMB we give priority because it is important in the public growth,” said Mr Straton Chilongola, the NMB Central Bank Zone Manager after handing over 102 desks to Mwasanga and Hekima primary schools in Mbeya town yesterday. During the occasion, the bank donated a total of 324 iron sheets to Mlima Reli Primary School for roofing activities in Mbeya District as well as beds, mattresses and bed sheets all valued at 25m/-. He said the bank has set aside 1bn/- to support community projects especially in health and education sectors, apart from any natural calamity that may arise being part of the corporate social responsibility. Earlier, Mwasanga Primary School Headmaster, Keneth Amon said the school faces high enrolment of pupils, in relation to few classes they have leading to shortage of their sitting desks. “There is a great enrolment in classes, and in the whole the school has 237 pupils, but in comparison to the number that keeps increasing, we are experiencing shortage of 140 desks and staff rooms,” he said. Mbeya District Commissioner Paul Ntinika said that really the bank recognises their woes and importance of helping them as a government, where they require assistance.
