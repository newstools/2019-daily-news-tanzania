BABATI District Council in Manyara Region estimates to have at least 41bn/- for development projects in the 2019/20 financial year. The money comes from the central government and the council’s own sources. Presenting to councillors during a meeting, Babati District Council Chairman Nicodemus Tarmo said they expected to collect 2,860,251,000/-. He noted that recurrent expenditure expected to be 1,320,921,000/-, salaries were projected at 29,612,917,190/- and development projects at 8,027,045,120.34. In the 2018/19 financial year, the council estimated collection from all its sources to reach 39,481,473,331.98, while until December, last year, it had collected 17,163,654.14 (equivalent to 43 per cent of 2018/19 budget estimates). The chairman mentioned lack of subvention in different development projects as one of the challenges the council faced in implementation of the 2018/19 budget. He said that had caused the council to fail to implement properly its development projects. Mr Tarmo added that reluctance of members of the public to pay crop levy was another challenge, as some of them declared that what they transported was below one tonne contrary to the government’s directive. He reminded all traders of the obligation to pay tax.
