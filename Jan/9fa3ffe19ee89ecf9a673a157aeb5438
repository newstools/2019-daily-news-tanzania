Petty traders in Dar es Salaam will be registered in an electronic database as of 1st of March in efforts to increase revenue collection, the Regional Commissioner, Paul Makonda has ordered. He directed regional officers yesterday to ensure all petty traders commonly known as Machingas were issued with special ID card in the same period to be allowed to operate in the city areas. “My region has received a total of 175,000 ID cards for Machingas which must be handed to them so that they can operate without disturbances." At the meeting that brought together Ward Executive offices, (WEO) security organs and heads of departments, Makonda said all petty traders must get the special IDs as they would not be allowed to work in the city areas after 1st of March. He told the leaders that there must be a special database stipulating all traders and their level of business so as to simplify revenue collection and voluntary tax compliance. “This is the country’s business capital, we must set favourable business climate and remain at the top of revenue collection among all regions as we must lead by example,” he said. The RC also directed his juniors to record industries in his region, medium as well as small scale traders for proper administration and keeping close contact. He warned District Executive Directors (DEDs) to speedup issuance and renewal of business licences and record them at the national data centre as a way of monitoring them easily and collect revenue
