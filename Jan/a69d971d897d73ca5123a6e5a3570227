KageraÂ Regional Commissioner (RC), Marco Gaguti, has stressed unity among Tanzanians urging people to be vigilant and report suspected aliens to relevant authorities for necessary action. Bukoba District Commissioner, Deodatus Kinawiro sounded the warning yesterday morning on behalf of Mr Gaguti while opening a bonanza organised by Jambo Bukoba. "Terrorism knows no bounds. People must be vigilant, taking into consideration that Kagera Region shares borders with four neighbouring countries of Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda and Kenya across Lake Victoria," he said. A one-minute silence was observed to remember innocent Kenyans who were killed by terrorists in the capital, Nairobi, a few weeks ago. Mr Gaguti stressed on the importance of unity among East African Community (EAC) member countries, saying that such unity will make the countries stronger economically and speed up peoples' development. He noted that the EAC countries -- Tanzania, Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, Burundi and South Sudan, with a combined population of 165 million, had a better chance to hasten peoples' development. "I hereby appeal to all residents in the EAC region to utilise this opportunity by trading and conducting business together. With unity we can perform wonders," he said. He welcomed investors, both local and foreign after upgrading of the Kimisi Game Reserve to National Reserve. "Investors are welcome to construct five star hotels and tour operators, thus creating employment. Residents in the region should utilise the opportunities," he said. Tourism earnings increased to 5.29tri/- (2,405.1 million US dollars) in the period ended February last year, up from 4.63tri/- (2,108.3 million US dollars) of the corresponding period 2016 due to rising of tourist arrivals. He thanked the United Kingdom (UK) and other development partners who supported the government in refurbishing the infrastructure damaged by the September 10, 2016 earthquake that killed 17 people.
