THE police force in Katavi Region has launched a manhunt for people involved in the murder of Ms Milembe Manoni (22), a resident of Tanganyika District. The suspects reportedly stabbed her on the chest multiple times, leading to her death. The incident was confirmed by Katavi Regional Police Commander (RPC), Damas Nyanda, who pointed out that a manhunt for the suspects was ongoing. Initial reports indicate that after committing the criminal offence, the suspects hid the victim’s body in a cattle shed next to her house. Ms Manoni’s mother identified as Ms Tuma Matine suspects that a boy who had been hired to tend her daughter’s cattle and had been living in the same house, could be among those suspected of involvement in the heinous act. The boy, whose identity has not been disclosed, is also at large. The RPC explained that the body of the murdered woman was preserved at Katavi designated hospital in Mpanda Town for a postmortem, following which it would be handed over to her relatives for burial. The Katavi regional chairman of a pastoralists’ umbrella organisation, Mr Mussa Kabushi, said the murder of pastoralists was rising, attributing the trend partly to the fact that they lived in isolated locations that lacked adequate security for themselves and their livetsock.
