CATHETERISATION laboratory—cath lab—an examination room with diagnostic imaging equipment to visualise the arteries of the heart, is set for launch at Benjamin Mkapa Hospital (BMH) next month. BMH Executive Director Dr Alphonse Chandika said here during a recent interview with the ‘Daily News’ that initially the hospital’s cardiologists will team up with their Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute (JKCI) counterparts to operate the lab. “This will help our cardiologists to borrow a leaf of experience from their JKCI counterparts in operating the cath lab. JKCI is the first public health facility in the country to be equipped with cath lab,” said Dr Chandika. Last September, Dr Chandika revealed that plans were underway for hospital to start performing cardiac surgeries on patients suffering from serious cardiac complications through the cath lab. He observed that the cath lab at the hospital would help people with cardiac complications in Dodoma and neighbouring regions who had to travel all the way to JKCI in Dar es Salaam for the medical services. “Cath lab is used to perform a number of cardiac interventions and treat any abnormality found in the human heart,” he said. Dr Chandika noted that statistics from the Paediatric Association of Tanzania (PAT) show that at least 13,600 infants are born with cardiac complications in the country annually and about 3,400 of them have to undergo surgery. BMH becomes second public health facility to offer cardiac health care through cath lab after JKCI and the third hospital in the country after JKCI and Aga Khan Hospital.
