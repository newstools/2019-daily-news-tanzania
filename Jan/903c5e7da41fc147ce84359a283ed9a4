Police Gender Desk officers in Dar es Salaam’s Ilala Police region, have urged the municipality to set aside a budget for the construction of well equipped police stations as it does for schools and health facilities. The officers said the move would help to smoothen their operations, especially for victims of gender-based violence (GBV), including sexual assaults, whose cases entailed privacy. They were speaking over the weekend during a workshop to discuss challenges that police officers handling GBV cases face. The workshop was organized as part of Women Fund sponsorship of which 10m/- was given to police gender desks for three-month public awareness campaigns. They stressed that according to their understanding, the Police Force was only tasked to post staff like teachers, doctors and nurses to physical facilities that were in place, as the ministries of education and health do. “Sexual corruption cases are more complicated since the victims need privacy to express themselves. The same applies for investigators who also need a good environment that facilitates thorough interrogations. All police stations should therefore have special rooms for such cases,” remarked Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Hamis Mulungwana. Commenting on the scope of the GBV problem in general, the Central Police OCD, SSP Israel Makongo, said considerable headway had been made, mainly as an outcome of public education. He stressed, however, that public awareness programmes should be extended by narrowing them from regional to ward level, to enable all community members to become key participants in the battle against GBV.
