Medical practitioners have vowed that they will, by all means, reject attempts by the government to regulate what they charge patients. In their defense, the doctors’ argue that their services are offered exclusively to the willing and those who feel that the rates are exorbitant are at liberty to keep off their jurisdictions. The lamentations come amid the release of a report by the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentist Board which had been mandated with the task of reviewing fees charged by medical practitioners in the country. As part of its mandate, the board was also expected to draw recommendations on how the country would go on to attain a better healthcare system. The state through the team that is led by KMPDB chair Professor George Magoha was acting on public outcry emanating from cases of exorbitant fees charged by private hospitals. A recent case that was widely reported where a patient was told to part with 800,000 Kenya shillings, after staying in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for less than 24hours in one of the private hospitals and later passed on raised a storm. In the report, the Magoha team appears to have made its conclusions and has already drafted guidelines on the subject but with far-reaching consequences. The guidelines set the minimum and maximum fees that professionals in private practice can charge for procedures. Among the suggestions the board will make will be to cut maximum fees for any procedure by 20 percent.
