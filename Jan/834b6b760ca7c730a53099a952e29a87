KARATU and Ngorongoro Districts are set to have two modern health facilities, thanks to a 1bn/- fund from the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority (NCAA) to finance them. Speaking during a handover ceremony of the funds here over the weekend, NCAA Board Chairperson, Professor Abiud Kaswamila reiterated the authority’s commitment in improving the health welfare of the two districts bordering the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA). “The health welfare of the Karatu and Ngorongoro residents has always been among our top priorities, the NCAA is committed to extend our support to other sectors as well,” he assured. According to Professor Kaswamila, the authority’s support to Karatu and Ngorongoro districts is also part of the NCAA’s ‘good neighbourliness’ (ujirani mwema) programme. In the same vein, he commended the communities surrounding the NCA for good neigbourliness and cooperation that has made the authority to minimise poaching. Through such efforts, Professor Kaswamila said the authority recently seized a number of weapons belonging to poachers. “We are grateful to our neighbours for being steadfast in protecting our natural resources,” he added. In her rejoinder, Karatu District Commissioner (DC), Ms Theresia Mahongo assured the NCAA that her office would put the money donated to them in good use, and promised to equally start the construction of the modern hospitals soon. According to Ms Mahongo, residents of the Karatu area still rely on the hospitals and health centres, which are run by religious organisations. “Karatu residents are at times forced to walk long distances to access healthcare, we hope that once the construction of the modern health facility becomes complete, we would have spared them such a hassle,” she pointed out.
