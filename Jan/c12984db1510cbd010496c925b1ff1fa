The High Court in Dar es Salaam has threw away the constitutional petition seeking to block the National Assembly from discussing the proposed amendments of the Political Parties Act in the forthcoming parliamentary session. Judge Benhajj Masoud ruled against Zitto Kabwe, Salum Bimani and Joram Bashange, as petitioners, after upholding two grounds of objections presented by the Attorney General. The AG, through a team of State Attorneys Mark Mulwambo, George Mandepo, Ponsiano Lukosi, Abubakar Mrisha, Rehema Mtulya and Kamihanda Masunga had objected to the hearing of the petition on grounds that it contained two prayers having different approach and effects.
