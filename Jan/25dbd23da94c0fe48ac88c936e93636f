BBC Hard Talk Presenter Stephen Sackur has demonstrated that he is well informed about achievements made during the three years of President John Magufuli’s sterling leadership, as he challenged criticisms and allegations made by Opposition Chief Whip Tundu Lissu. Mr Sackur was hard on Mr Lissu, saying Tanzanians seemed to appreciate what President Magufuli’s administration was doing, particularly on delivering upon his promises when he sought the presidency. “Some Tanzanians are listening to you, they listen to the President and weigh up some messages, right now the President enjoys an approval rating as some measures him at over 50 per cent and some rating him at over 70 per cent. There is every sign that he, and the ruling party are going to win and win big in the next round of elections,” he told Mr Lissu. He said Dr Magufuli’s administration had promised to cut down much of the corruption in the country. “We saw in the first weeks or months of his administration, thousands of ghost workers being removed from the payroll and we saw some very senior figures being removed from the payroll because they were corrupt, so if you ask some Tanzanians they feel their country is clean, less corrupt, that is quietly an achievement,” he added. On private investors, the presenter differed with Mr Lissu who alleged that the President attacked the business community and private investors. The presenter argued that what Dr Magufuli did was to deliver on his specific promises made to get a little bit tougher on foreign corporate, including those huge mining companies who have been making vast profits out of Tanzania’s natural resources. During the interview, Mr Lissu, who is also Member of Parliament for Singida East (Chadema) seemed to get off the track when the presenter cast the questions.
