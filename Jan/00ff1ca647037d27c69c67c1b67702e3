Motorists and riders have commended Serengeti Breweries Limited (SBL) campaign to impart knowledge on safe driving in an effort to end tragic road incidents. A motorcyclist, Martin Njelekela recently described the campaign as innovative, eye-opener and focused, noting that since he attended the session had learnt to never ride his motorcycle while under the influence of alcohol. “The education that I received from SBL campaign on road safety and dangers of driving or riding while drunk has completely changed my previous erroneous perception,” he said. He added, “I previously thought that drinking and driving was a trendy but after getting the knowledge from SBL game changer I am now able to fully adhere to road safety rules by always avoiding alcohol while riding.” A long distance driver, Edwin Mosha with 10 years’ experience said the campaign had inspired him to practice safe driving as well as ‘tell the story’ to his peers on the benefits of driving while ‘sober’.
