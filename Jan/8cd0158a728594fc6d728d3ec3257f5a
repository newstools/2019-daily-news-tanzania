THE Zanzibar Electricity Corporation (ZECO) has signed a three-year agreement with Maxicom Africa Company in which the latter will provide power consumers with easy and more convenient way of paying their bills electronically. Maxicom Africa Company through its MaxMalipo will provide services in many areas of Zanzibar where electricity customers, particularly living far from ZECO selling points as they pay for the utility through technological devices managed by local people running shops. Both ZECO and MaxMalipo officers were optimistic about the new project targeting more than 170,000 customers across Zanzibar and that the system through more than 200 agents will cover many villages. Mr Hassan Ali Mbarouk- General Manager, ZECO said, “As we expand our services in villages, we need to ensure our customers find easy way of paying bills. We hope MaxMalipo will narrow the existing gap.” Mr Robert Mng’anya- Technical Director and Mr Mussa Kissena- Commercial Manager from MaxMalipo said that, “This deal with ZECO will definitely minimize or end inconveniences in paying bills for power consumers in Zanzibar.” The MaxMalipo officers said agents are required to pay 649,000/- for each machine that enables payments, but down played reports of complaints from some of their agents that their machines have technical problems during operation, saying plans are underway to have more modern machines with advanced technology.
