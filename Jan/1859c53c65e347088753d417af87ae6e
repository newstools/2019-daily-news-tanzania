NATIONAL Social Security Fund (NSSF) has embarked on a special programme aimed at benefiting fishermen in the country, its Marketing and Public Relations Manager Lulu Mengele has said. She said here over the weekend, pointing out that fishermen were among the social groups, which have for long been left behind in the benefits offered by the social security funds. “The special programme aims at benefiting all social groups, including fishermen, who have been left behind in benefits offered by social security funds,” she said. Ms Mengele noted that NSSF came up with the idea to encourage fishermen to join NSSF after realising that despite meeting their requirements to join the fund, majority of them have not joined. “Many fishermen are unaware of the benefits offered by social security funds, hence suffer when experiencing disasters like accidents while carrying out their activities,” she observed. Ms Mengele hinted that once they become members, besides health benefit, they will also enjoy soft loans for education and other development activities for their families. She explained that the special programme that aims at benefiting the social groups left behind by social security funds would equally facilitate them in a number of initiatives carried out by the government to alleviate poverty. “The fishermen will also benefit from pensions after clocking the mandatory retirement age, and hence fight poverty,” she said. Ms Mengele said at least 4.5 million people living near water bodies in the country are engaged in fishing activities, citing some of the water bodies as the Indian Ocean, Lake Victoria, Lake Nyasa and Lake Tanganyika.
