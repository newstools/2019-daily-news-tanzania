MINISTER of State in the Presidentâ€™s Office, Regional Administration and Local Government, Selemani Jafo has ordered the district councils in Kigoma Region to increase productivity of the One Stop Centre offices for improved efficiency in revenue repayment to local traders and entrepreneurs Jafo gave the directive when he visited the One Stop Centre at Kigoma Ujiji Municipal Council, saying that the good environment that enables traders to adhere to business procedures in a short period attracts entrepreneurs to pay taxes voluntarily. He said bureaucracy leads to traders spending more time dealing with trading processes, the situation that discourages traders and entrepreneurs from paying their taxes voluntarily and timely. Minister Jafo demanded the value for money in implementation of statefunded construction projects, charging that the 53m/- spent on the one stop centre building does not reflect the value for money. Speaking in front of the minister, Kigoma Ujiji Business Officer Festo Nashon said about 53m/- was used on the construction of the building to help improve the business environment. The Local Investment Centre (LIC) is the one of the buildings built in six districts of Kigoma Region. According to Mr Nashon, there remains a major challenge to access tax authorities and immigration due to their absence in the building that envisages offering all services under one roof.
