WATER Deputy Minister, Jumaa Aweso now wants former water engineer in Karatu, Tulinumpoki Mwakalukwa to be recalled to the district for allegedly doing shoddy work on a 3bn/ water project. The deputy minister directed district authorities to have Mr Mwakalukwa be brought back to Karatu, after realising that he failed to deliver on the failed project. Mr Aweso said he was determined to have an audience with the troubled water engineer on why he underperformed in the water project that was completed in 2013. “The engineer is probably enjoying life somewhere when Karatu residents are grappling with dry taps, I need to see the engineer here in Karatu in two weeks-time,” remarked the deputy minister on Saturday, shortly after he was updated on Karatu water crisis. The deputy minister decried the tendency of relocating engineers and contractors, once they have underperformed in mega projects, adding that he wouldn’t tolerate such practice under his watch. “Engineers who miss out on their targets will not be relocated, but they’ll be removed from duty with immediate effect,” the deputy minister warned. Mr Aweso was forced to cut short his tour of some villages worst hit by water crisis in Karatu District after he learnt of the engineer’s relocation. In the same vein, the minister directed officials from his office to fast-track a financial claim raised by Engineering Plus (T) Limited on Tom water project. Earlier on, the chairperson of Karatu District Council Mr Jubilate Mnyenye told the deputy minister that the water crisis in the district was likely to spell doom to the livelihoods of more than 40,000 onion farmers at Mang’ola Ward. “Nearly 80 per cent of the onions from Karatu are exported to Kenya…the farmers’ livelihoods will be in peril if the water crisis isn’t resolved,” he said.
