Foreign reserves have fallen by $421.7 million in three months, from the record high of $5,500.5 million in August 2018. The balance of payment deficit increased more than four folds in a month to record a deficit of $753 million in the month of November from $171.6 million in October 2018 on account of increased imports especially of capital goods to feed major infrastructure projects undertaken by the government. A continuous deterioration of foreign reserves and increasing balance of payment deficit may put pressure on the stability of the shilling in the near future considering the persistent volatility of global oil prices, U.S tightening policies and uncertainties brought by ongoing trade wars between America and different trading partners most notably China.
