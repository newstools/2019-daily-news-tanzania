A GRAPE processing factory, which will be able to supply bulk wine to wine factories in the country, is set to be constructed at Chinangali II Village in Buigiri Ward, Chamwino District. Chamwino District Council Director Athumani Masasi told ‘Daily News’ yesterday that the 20bn/- project would start August this year and would be completed after six months. “Grape growers will soon benefit from a reliable grape market, thanks to the first grape processing plant in the country, which will also create over 1,000 jobs,” Chamwino District Director noted. Mr Masasi said the factory would help uplift the livelihood of grape growers in Chamwino in particular and Dodoma in general, adding that the factory would also help increase revenue collection in the district. Dodoma is the country’s main grape growing region in Tanzania making the country the second largest producer of the cash crop after South Africa in sub-Saharan Africa. Mr Masasi pointed out Chamwino District Council had teamed up with Workers Compensation Fund and Tanzania Investment Bank to carry out the project after signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with public institutions last March. “Consultants from Archquant Service Limited are currently reviewing a business plan for the project for improvement,” he said, adding that the project would be implemented in three phrases, which would include the installation of processing plants in the last phase. Mr Masasi said lack of a reliable grape market had for many years been a big challenge to grape growers in Chamwino, saying the establishment of the grape processing factory would address the problem.
