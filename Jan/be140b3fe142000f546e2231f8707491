THE government is verifying a debt amounting to 241m/-, which Air Tanzania Company Limited (ATCL) owes to Zanzibar Airport Authority (ZAA) in landing fee. Works, Transport and Communications Deputy Minister, Atashasta Nditiye told the National Assembly yesterday that the payment of the debt would be made after ongoing verification. “The authority responsible for verification is working on it. We will settle the debt after verification,” he said. His statement was after Mr Jaku Ayoub, Member of the Zanzibar House of Representatives, wanted to hear the government’s statement on the outstanding debt. Mr Ayoub also complained that passenger aircraft from Zanzibar to the capital city of Dodoma took more hours due to lack of direct flights to Dodoma. Passengers from Zanzibar have to connect flights from Julius Nyerere International Airport (JNIA) in Dar es Salaam. “This causes delays of passengers, who want to fly to Dodoma,” he said. But, Mr Nditiye said ATCL was still purchasing more airplanes to cover more routes. He, therefore, assured that passengers from Zanzibar would get direct flights to Dodoma after the state-owned airline acquired more planes. He went on to explain that government’s plans were to enable all Tanzanians get air transport at any destination with commercial interests. The company uses Dar es Salaam as a hub to fly passengers to many places and thus meet commercial needs. Zanzibar has been singled out as one of the destinations for commercial interests.
