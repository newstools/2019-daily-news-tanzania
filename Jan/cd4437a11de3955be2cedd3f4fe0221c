WOMEN in the country have been urged to make use of the various available opportunities to acquire knowledge and skills to improve their standards of living, in a bid to reduce dependency and free themselves from abject poverty. Dr Naomi Makota made a call shortly after she was conferred with a PhD by the Open University of Tanzania (OUT) at a graduation ceremony held at the University’s main grounds in Kibaha Township, Coast Region over the weekend. The fresh expert who specialised in urban area formalisation projects, said women had an immense contribution in facilitating the achievement of the fifth phase government’s objective of becoming a middle income and an industrialised country by 2025 by using available opportunities to achieve economic independency. “As women, we have a big contribution in achieving the government’s objective of becoming a middle income and industrialised country by 2025; the time has come to shun primitive beliefs that a woman is dependent; we should work hard to beat that myth,” Dr Naomi said. She pointed out that formalisation of properties was vital as it gives equal rights to own property for both genders; therefore if women own land and other properties, it translates into equal opportunities to improve their standards of living. “I would like to advise fellow women to grab available opportunities in a bid to raise their income and contribute to national revenue in efforts to contribute to he government’s objective of becoming a middle income and industrialised country by 2025,” she said.
