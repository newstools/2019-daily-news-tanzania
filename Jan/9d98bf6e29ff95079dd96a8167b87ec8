LIVESTOCK and Fisheries Minister, Luhaga Mpina (pictured), has smelt a rat in the livestock vaccination ongoing programme, with some dishonest traders inflating the prices of the vaccines. According to the Minister, the situation has been forcing pastoralists to dig deeper into their pockets to incur extra costs, which can not be accounted for. With the situation, Mr Mpina directed Director of Veterinary Services at the ministry to prepare a guideline that would guide the whole system, ranging from production, importation, supplying and costs of vaccinating an animal, publicly to the herders. He said the guideline should set indicative prices that would enable the livestock keepers to get official and affordable prices of the vaccination. “For many years the pastoralists have been exploited by buying the vaccination at prices five times more than the actual prices, despite some vaccinations being produced locally in the country,” he added. He hinted that the situation was going out of control, unless effective control and provision of the vaccination are put in place, something that has been discouraging the pastoralists. Mr Mpina issued the directives after visiting the Tanzania Veterinary Institute (TVI) and the Tanzania Veterinary Laboratory Agency (TVLA) yesterday. The TVI produces vaccine that can vaccinate 100 cows for only 200/-, but some officials of the councils and dishonest traders are using the same vaccine and charge the herders 5,000/- per cow. Some councils have also been unfairly penalizing pastoralists with tramped charges as fines, and the money they collect not going back to serve the livestock, instead, end up as their personal allowances, something he termed as a criminal offence. However, Director of Veterinary Services, Dr Hezron Nonga, assured the minister that they would immediately implement his directives and bring to book errant officers in their midst.
