THE decline in overall lending rate pushed up credit extended to private sector to 15tri/- in the year to November last year compared to 14tri/- in the preceding period, following measures taken to improve credit information of borrowers using credit reference database. According to the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) monthly economic review for December, overall lending rate declined to an average of 16.95 per cent in November last year from 17.63 per cent in the corresponding month in 2017. “Reflecting the impact of accommodative monetary policy and measures taken to improve credit information of borrowers using credit reference database, overall lending rate declined to an average of 16.95 per cent in November last year from 17.63 per cent in the corresponding month in 2017,” stated the report. The overall time deposits rate averaged 7.73 per cent in November last year compared with 9.60 per cent in corresponding month in 2017, with one-year deposit rate declining to an average of 7.94 per cent from 11.27 per cent. During the period under review, domestic credit by the banking system, which comprises of credit extended to the Government and private sector, grew by 9.5 per cent during the year ending November last year. The outturn was higher than growth rate of 6.4 per cent in the year to October 2018 and a contraction of 4.6 per cent in the year ending November 2017. Much of the increase of domestic credit emanated from private sector credit, which grew at an annual rate of 5.0 per cent in November last year compared with 4.8 per cent and 1.9 per cent in October 2018 and November 2017, respectively. This was partly an outcome of accommodative monetary policy and improving assets quality of banks. Trade and manufacturing sectors and personal related activities—mostly for small and medium financing remained the major beneficiaries of credit extended by banks to the private sector.
