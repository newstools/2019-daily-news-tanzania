HI! Happy new year, as 2019 is rolling on some of us are very disappointed when we look back to what we achieved in 2018, as long as you are still alive don’t be carried away by those who say you cannot do any better in your life because you are too old and your time is almost over, just keep the faith and work very hard but smart like an eagle which is able to rejuvenate its life at its old age. How do they do it? Few years ago media reports from Australia showed that an eagle attempted to snatch a baby in a small town called Alice Springs which is located in Northern Territory between big cities of Darwin and Adelaide, the incident happened during a bird show when the fearless eagle tried to fly away with a terrified boy crying for his life. Different sources indicate that the eagle is a very unique bird with extraordinary abilities, when humans count beautiful birds the eagle is not included in the list, on the other hand history show that an eagle is among nature’s most wonderful creature which inspired people from many years ago, the eagle is a carnivorous, mysterious bird which is frequently taken as symbols of power, courage and freedom, on its side the bird treats itself as a confident creature. All birds which are found in this group are carnivorous while the vulturine African fish eagle may look and eat some fruits found around big water bodies such as lake Victoria, Tanganyika and Nyasa where the Matengo, Ngoni and Bena people use the word Ngwazi for this bird which they consider as the symbol of knowledge and power. On their side scientists say these birds are very clever because they are able to detect a mass of rising hot air which they fly in to use the column as a ladder to soar very high in the sky for many hours without the need of flapping their wings, because of their bigger size female are believed to have more advantage when using this type of flight in the sky because they serve a good amount of energy. On the shores of the Indian ocean along Saadani park some Martial eagle have been seen snatching sea turtles from the water and carry their catch to nearby hard rock where it is dropped and crush the shell into small pieces and provide food to the hungry carnivorous and others which will benefit from the leftovers. All the above accounts show that eagles are fearless and they will never give up and they are relentlessly focused on achieving their goal it is believed that they will never surrender to the overwhelming size or weight of their prey. They are fearless in their hunting strategies and some even prey on goats. Among these birds, the crown eagle is well gifted with courage to stand against any threat but the Martial eagle is very famous throughout Africa south of the Sahara for its fearless attitude. Unlike other birds, the martial eagle prefer to dwell in protected areas such as national parks and game reserves where it occupy an area covering about 1,000 square kilometrers which the bird do not allow any other bird to get closer, these are apex predators which have developed a unique taste on flesh from large snakes such as black mamba, cobra and pythons. By using powerful force they will throw all their weight through long talons to kill a very big python measuring about 4.8 to 6 metres and weigh between 44 and 55 kilogrammes but deep in Moyowosi game receive fewer courageous martial eagle are believed to target and kill very big pythons which weigh between 60 and 91 kilogrammes. Under normal circumstances this is almost impossible but scientists say these birds know how to use their sharp beaks measuring 5,5 centimetres, this extra ordinary ability is very well displayed when this very big birds such Kori bustard that weigh about 16 kilogrammes, not only that these birds are known to target and kill small mammals such as monkey, duckie and Dik dik. Scientists say these birds prefer to stay in one part of the forest even if the supply of food in that area has been affected by natural forces such as drought, they will stay there until the situation improve, among eagles. Young birds always migrate to new area to look for partners and new pasture and whenever they found a good place they always mark their arrival with special ritual which goes with loud noises. This is a special show whereby a male attempts to attract a mate and exhibit his desire to copulate, these behaviours often include ritualized movements or dance, vocalizations, mechanical sound production together with the displays of beauty and strength, among eagles, usually territorial displays, which outnumber breeding displays, occur around the periphery of the bird’s home range while breeding displays are likely to be made over or at least near the nest. This is a beautiful game because the displays consists of a series of steep dives and ascents, with few rhythmical wing flaps at the top of each climb and descending circles which draw number eight in the sky, during the display which is done to purify themselves for a courtship, eagles can drop as much as 60 metres at a time before circling back up and during this display, the male is noisy, uttering a shrill sound according to its specie while throwing its head back also singing in a thrilling sound for approximately 30 seconds. Among eagles, in this kind of display a male partner may reach heights exceeding 900 metres above the ground, sometimes even near cloud level at over 2,000 metres above the ground but the adult female may also perform independent display flights, uttering a responding call as its seems to display less. On another stage of the ritual, eagle pairs also perform a spectacular display when arising from the ground and come together after a brief separation in the sky, in this stage of the ritualized courtship display a spectacular tandems dance that involve interlocking talons which allow the falling from a high distance in the sky which is very rare among other birds in the savannah. As the dance contributes to initiate the breeding process, adult eagles are known to perform another unique ritual which extend their life span from 40 to 70 years of age, scientists say after bird reaches more than 40 years it become very old to perform its normal duties because its long talons are worn out, its beak bent backward and lose the ability to piece or cut things including meat from a prey as a result the bird is unable to hunt and make a kill for food, due to the old age the bird’s feathers became very heavy so it cannot fly. At this point the nature steps in with two options for the bird, to do another ritual or stay down for a fast approaching death, this is a do or die ritual which needs the bird to fly into a very safe area where it will crush the beak on a rock until it is totally broken down, this is painful ritual that takes about 150 days. This is a very difficult process whereby an individual will firstly remove most of its 7,000 feathers then crush its beak and slip into a unique state to hibernate, during this period the talons are removed as the bird serve its energy for rebirth because its talons are replaced with new ones, the beak grow back with a sharp curved point and new feathers covers the body and at this stage the eagle is ready to fly and leave for more than 30 years. By knocking its beak on a rock until it is plucked out they pays a special price for its need to rejuvenating its life, this is a lesson for those who need to change their lives in 2019, meanwhile these birds are found in more than 60 species of powerfully built birds of prey which are found in Australia, North and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa where greater and lesser spotted eagles, crown eagle, martial eagle, African fish eagle and snake eagle are found in different protected areas. From more than three million years ago after glaciers and deserts emerged in different parts of the world ancestors of eagles were separated into different sub species which are found in different parts of the world. Witnesses of the incident said the daring the attack the bird attempted to take the frightened boy like a small mammal, it was very scary because the eagle pressed its sharp and long 5 centimetres on his skin and the boy cried and forced workers of the park to come to chase the bird which flew away for a second attempt on another boy, the second attempt forced the management of the park to close the show and all eagles were removed from the show. However, when faced with different challenges in the savannah eagles are credited with courage and endurance, this is what gave the special positions and respects among human after lions, at different levels, most of these birds are facing difficulties because of human activities including poaching and deforestation, please take your responsibility today to make the world a better place for every creature!.
