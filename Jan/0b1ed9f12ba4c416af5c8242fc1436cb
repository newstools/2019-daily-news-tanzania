WATER and Irrigation Deputy Minister, Juma Aweso has directed councils in the country to award water project tenders to qualified contractors, who are financially viable. Speaking during the commencement of his three-day tour of Kagera Region yesterday, Mr Aweso said: “I have received reports indicating that some of the water projects, which cost millions of taxpayers’ money are non-functioning, while others are yet to be completed. Councils should ensure water projects given to qualified contractors, who are financially viable to avoid similar mistakes,” he said. Citing an example he said a contractor was paid about 476m/- for a water project at Katoke Village in Muleba District, but the project had stalled and people were not getting water. He expressed disappointment with some of the water engineers, who had failed to supervise well the projects, warning that stern measures would be taken against them. Mr Aweso commended Bukoba Urban Water and Sewerage Authority (Buwasa) for good performance in implanting a 30bn/- project. Buwasa Executive Director, Allen Marwa informed Mr Aweso that the project capacity was 18 million litres, while demand for Bukoba Municipal Council was 13 million litres. He explained that to date water production was 9.5 million litres, adding that 10 out of the 14 wards were being served by the water utility. “Four other wards - Nyanga, Kahororo, Ijuganyondo and Buhembe -would be served after setting up extension tanks in different areas,” he said. Mr Marwa noted that the water utility was functioning at 88 per cent capacity, but the target was to achieve 95 per cent by 2020.
