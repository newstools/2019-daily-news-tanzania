THE Public Service Commission has said there is blatant disregard of the law that guides employment in the public service, creating several complaints from employees. Deputy Minister of State in the President’s Office, Public Service and Good Governance Dr Mary Mwanjelwa revealed the information in Dar es Salaam yesterday when speaking at the training of seven members of the Public Service Commission who were sworn in by President John Magufuli at State House in Dar es Salaam on Wednesday. On December 4 last year, President Magufuli appointed the seven-member team under Justice (rtd) Steven Bwana to lead the Public Service Commission for a three-year period. The members were sworn in by Dr Magufuli on Wednesday. They include George Yambesi, Ambassador John Haule, Immaculate Ngwale, Yahaya Mbila and Ambassador Daniel Ole Njoolay. Officiating at the training, the deputy minister asked the commissioners to do justice for all public servants and ensure that all the appeals submitted before them were treated fairly. “There are many complaints on blatant disregard of Employment Act, especially in the local government, we therefore want you to treat all the appeals fairly on a transparent manner,’’ she said. She asked them to increase creativity in the course of discharging their duties and timely work on the appeals submitted to them.
