An explosion followed by heavy gunfire has been reported at 14 Riverside in Westlands, Nairobi. Unconfirmed reports indicate there was an explosion outside one of the buildings before gunshots filled the air at around 3PM, East Africa time. Witnesses say they saw four armed men entering the complex. Vehicles are on fire in the car park. People are being evacuated. Police have cordoned off the area and are trying to rescue those trapped inside. "I just started hearing gunshots, and then started seeing people running away raising their hands up and some were entering the bank to hide for their lives," a woman told a local journalist.
