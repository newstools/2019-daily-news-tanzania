AZAM and Taifa Stars striker Yahya Zayed left yesterday for Cairo, Egypt to complete a three-year deal with Egyptian giants, Ismailia. Zayed, who is aged 20, left aboard Ethiopian Airline and upon his arrival he would sign the contract to serve the team. The young player is urgently needed by Ismailia who are currently placed 15th in the Egyptian Premier League. If he signs the contract with the Egyptian club, Zayed will be the second Tanzanian to feature in the Egyptian top flight league after Himid Mao who still plays for Petrojet. In August last year South African club Bidves Wits called Zayed for a two-week trial, but allowed him to go back to his former club for further development. He had signed a two-year contract with Azam as a player who has been developed in the team’s academy. Zayed played in the Azam squad that clinched East African Club Championship in Dar es Salaam last year. Zayed contributed much in his team’s success as he leaves the team second-positioned in the 20-team league. Azam have hauled 40 points from 17 matches. They have won 12 matches, drew four others and lost once. Zayed leaves Azam with 26 goals for and eight goal against, hence standing with 18 Goal deference with two matches before the completion of the first round. Azam continue to be good academy of successful young player. Azam have also provided Farid Mussa and Shaaban Iddi Chilunda who both serve Spanish Club Tenerife.
