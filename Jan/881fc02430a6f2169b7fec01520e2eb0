THERE have been a number of incidences, where students coming from night studies and late classes from Arusha Technical College (ATC), being attacked, robbed and molested by unknown gangs. That was said over the weekend by the Arusha Technical College Acting Rector, Dr Masoud Senzia at the institution’s 10th graduation ceremony here, adding that they are direly in need of hostels to accommodate the students for majorly security purposes. “Many of our students have been attacked and robbed by criminals at night, while returning to their residential homes after classes, or evening preps and so far, two of them have been wounded in the process,” pointed out Dr Senzia. He named the students as Epimachius Experius, a First-Year, studying Electrical and Automation, who suffered knife stabs in his stomach. “He was admitted in hospital and after being discharged, the student no longer wanted to continue with education here,” added the Rector. The other victim was Francis Mathew, who was also taking Degree in Electrical and Automation, who was attacked twice and wounded in various parts of his anatomy. “Nearly 65 per cent of all our students stay off-campus and face similar challenges of encountering gangs of attackers, when they leave late for home,” added Dr Senzia, while conferring degrees to 411 graduants, where 112 of them were girls accounting for 28 per cent of the total lot. However, he hinted that there are some ongoing construction projects at the ATC, funded through the soft loans of the African Development Bank, worth nearly 7bn/- to construct three new storey buildings, which would be used as Classrooms, and a Laboratory connected with a wireless internet networking in the campus. On her side, the institution Acting Board Chairperson, Engineer Ruth Koya however said they have seen a great increase of the students’ intake since 2017 to this year registering 3,390 students.
