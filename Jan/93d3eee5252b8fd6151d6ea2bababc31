OVER 10 illegal immigrants from Ethiopia were found dead and abandoned along Morogoro-Iringa Road. They were found dead at Sangasanga Village, Mvomero District, in Morogoro Region. Morogoro Regional Police Commander (RPC) Willbrod Mutafungwa told reporters that 26 illegal immigrants were carried in a truck with a container and 13 of them suffocated and one died at hospital, where he was rushed to. “At least 13 illegal immigrants and 13 dead bodies were found at Sangasanga Village in Mvomero District. The 14th person died at the hospital, where he was rushed to,” said the RPC. He noted that they were found at about 3pm on December 30, last year. The RPC further said that the police did not find any vehicle. He said: “We rushed to the scene after getting information on the matter. However, we did not find any vehicle there except weak persons and 13 dead bodies,” he said. According to Mr Mutafungwa, the police are investigating the matter so that the vehicle that carried them could be seized and the culprits arrested. Regional Immigration Officer Safina Muhindi said only two illegal immigrants were found with passports. She said the passports indicated that the two entered the country on August 24, last year. Morogoro Regional Commissioner, Dr Kebwe Stephen Kebwe, asked the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) in Morogoro to contact their fellows in Dar es Salaam to investigate and come up with information on the number of containers that carried the illegal immigrants. He said TRA was in a good position to support security organs to investigate the matter.
