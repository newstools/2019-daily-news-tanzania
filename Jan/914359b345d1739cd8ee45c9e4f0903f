THE Court of Appeal has saved three local petroleum jelly producer companies, Mamujee Products Limited, Tanga Pharmaceutical and Plastics Limited and Asher Industries Limited, from paying about 3bn/- as excise duty to the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA). A panel composed of Justices Ibrahim Juma and Justices Augustine Mwarija and Richard Mziray ruled in favour of the three companies after dismissing the appeal the Commissioner General with TRA, as appellant, had lodged to challenge findings of the Tax Revenue Appeals Tribunal. In the appeal, TRA contended that the Tribunal erred in law by holding that petroleum jelly could not be classified under Harmonized System (HS) Code Heading No. 3304.99.00 of the East African Community External Tariff (CET) 2012 Version and that its correct category is under Heading No. 2712.10.00. However, the justices said that the petroleum jelly product is specifically classified under heading 27.12 and according to Rule 1 of the General Interpretation Rules for Classification of Goods and explanatory notes cannot be used to exclude it from that heading and include it under another heading. “Guided by that rule and decisions cited by counsel for the respondents (the three companies) which, in our view, state the correct position of the law, we agree with (them) that this appeal is devoid of merit. As a consequence, the same is hereby dismissed with costs,” they declared. The dispute has its origin in legislative amendment to the Excise (Management and Tariff) Act, 2002. Through section 12 of the Finance Act No. 4 of 2013, the Parliament amended the Fourth Schedule to the Excise Act (the Schedule) by introducing under heading 33.04 new excisable items and rates. The introduced items under that heading fall under the following description: “Perfumes and toilet waters, - beauty or make-up preparations and preparations for the care of the skin (other than medicaments), including sunscreen or sun tan preparations; manicure or pedicure preparations.” The introduced items, which are excisable at the rate of 10 percent with their respective HS Codes in brackets are; lip make up preparation (3304.10.00), Eye make-up preparation (3304.20.00) and manicure or pedicure preparation (3304.30.00). Under this description, the items shown as “other”, classified in HS Code 3304.99.00 are excisable at the rate of 10 percent. The respondent companies were at the material time of the enactment of the Act, producers of the petroleum jelly. Following the amendment to the Schedule in that manner, the respondents companies were subjected by the appellant to payment of excise duty on the product. They disagreed with the appellant, contending that they were not liable to pay excise duty because the product is codified under HS Code 27.12.10 of the EAC CET and could not be excisable under HS Code 3304.99.00 as one of the other items under the nomenclature of the products under heading 33.04. The respondents’ attempts to resist the appellant’s demand for payments of excise duty on the product were unsuccessful. They had to make payment under protest in the sums of 1,115,800,852/=, 1,190,081,466.36 and 557,547,634/=, respectively while taking action to seek redress. They did so by filing an application in the Tax Revenue Appeals Board (the Board), Income Tax Application No.6 of 2015. Having considered the submissions and the provisions of 5.124(1) of the Excise Act, the Board found that, in the Schedule, the Product is not classified under heading 33.04 but the same is under HS Code 2712.10.00 of the EAC CET. For that reason, it found that it is not excisable. Relying on the applicable principle on construction of tax statutes as stated in the English case of Cape Brandy Syndicate against Inland Revenue Commissioner [1921] IKB 64, the Board was of the view that the product cannot be charged under “other” items appearing in HS Code 3304.99.00. It reasoned that whereas the product is specifically listed under HS Code 2712.10, it could not be implied to be excisable under another Code, HS Code 3304.99.00. The Board observed that, if the Parliament had intended to include the product in the list of excisable items under a different HS Code, it should have expressly done so by listing it in the Schedule. As a result, the Board granted the application and ordered the TRA to refund the amounts of money collected from the companies as excise duty on the product. The TRA was aggrieved by the decision and appealed to the Tribunal, which also upheld the findings of the Board.
