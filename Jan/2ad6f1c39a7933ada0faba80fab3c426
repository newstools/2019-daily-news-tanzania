YOUNG Africans Head Coach Mwinyi Zahera said his team was not lucky and wasted a number of scoring chances when they lost 1-0 to Stand United over the weekend. It was Yanga’s first loss after playing 19 matches undefeated and Stand United, the team that have twice beaten Yanga at CCM Kambarage Stadium, ended the team’s solo run after five months since the league started in August last year. The match solitary goal was netted by Jacob Massawe, who previously served Mwanza United, Ndanda FC and Toto African in the 87th minute. Coach Zahera added his team created three chances but his players failed to utilise them. “If well utilised, we could have ended the winners of the tense game,” he said. But, the big problem to him was the poor shape of Kambarage Stadium pitch which he said was full of water due to the ongoing downpour. ‘’ I do not have much to say my players did not work the way we expected, but the rain made us fail to play a k i n d o f foot- ball we play something that forced us to rely much on high balls,” he said. Zahera said Stand United team did not play well either despite winning the game. They just got one chance and used it well against his team. According to him, Stand United played poorly in comparison with Mwadui FC whom they faced prior to the match with Stand United and Yanga won 3-1. Despite the defeat, Yanga still lead the league table with 53 points after playing 20 games. Stand United head Coach Athuman Bilal said his team played well, something that helped his team get victory. The former Toto Africans Coach, Bilal said he will still continue with tactics to ensure his team perform well in the remaining games of the league. After the Sunday victory, Stand United are now placed 13th with 25 points after playing 22 games
