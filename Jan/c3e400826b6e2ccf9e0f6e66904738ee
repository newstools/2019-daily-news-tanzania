Acamedicians from Netherlands-based Groningen University and Avinalishingam Institute for Home Science and Higher Education for Women in India have joined their local counterparts of Institute of Financial Management (IFM) to discuss, among other things, extension of field time for students to produce graduates, who keep abreast of market demand. Speaking during the 8th International Conference Development Policy yesterday, they stressed that practical studies should be prioritised since the situation proved to have been encouraging creativity/ innovation in students and enable them to come up with simple and affordable technologies, which easily solved societal problems. They said in developing countries practical studies accelerated entrepreneurship skills, which made graduates go for self-employment that must be inculcated in Tanzanian students. “Intensification of field time is crucial for Tanzania, especially this time, when the country is in a transitional period to industrialisation. Almost every sector of the economy needs creativity for availability of affordable technologies. Theories alone cannot encourage innovation. Students must have enough time to practise their professions,” said Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries Development, Prof Elisante Ole Gabriel. For her part, Vice Chancellor of Avinalishingam Institute, Dr Premavathy Vijayan, said entrepreneurship was looked upon as an important source of job creation and a venture to facilitate economic growth as it paved the way for much competitiveness and innovation. However, she added that entrepreneurial development could not be confined to just providing prospective entrepreneurs with requisite administrative and financial support, but also went beyond it and included measures to impart entrepreneurial skills to the youth and inculcate in them creativity, a spirit of taking initiatives and a sense of responsibility.
