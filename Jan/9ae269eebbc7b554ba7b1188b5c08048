IN a bid to promote hatchery in the country, the Tanzania Livestock Research Institute (TALIRI) has donated 3,676 chicken egg incubators to 135 villages in different regions including Dodoma for the past year. Director General of TALIRI, Dr Eligy Shirima, made the revelation here recently, pointing out that apart from supplying the chicken egg incubators, TALIRI through its seven centres in the country monitors hatchery to households, which received them. “TALIRI also counsels the households on hatchery and good management of chicken egg incubators,” said the TALIRI boss. Dr Shirima pointed out the initiative to distribute the chicken egg incubators was part of TALIRI’s strategic plan to encourage villagers to engage in hatchery as income generating activity. Under the strategic plan, the TALIRI’s Director General, said the villagers also received free training on ideal hatchery from TALIRI through its seven centres, citing the centres as Kongwa, Mabuki, Tanga, Mpwapwa, Naliendele, Uyole and Kilimanjaro. He added that after the training, TALIRI provided the residents with chicken egg incubators so that they engage in hatchery on their own and make the programme become sustainable. Dr Shirima said the other ongoing programme carried out by TALIRI was producing hay in 84 districts in 22 Regions, adding that so far the institution has supplied 4,000 kilogrammes of seeds to the members to produce hay in the regions. “TALIRI also plans to team up with foreign research institutes in order to carry out a number of research projects to improve livestock and hatchery in the country,” he hinted. Dr Shirima said currently TALIRI through its seven centres is carrying out a programme to produce dairy goats, saying the programme aims at producing 15,000 dairy goats by 2020.
