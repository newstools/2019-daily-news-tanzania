Minister for Minerals, Dotto Biteko has dismissed 57 members of staff since he assumed office two weeks ago over unethical and corrupt practices. President John Magufuli appointed Mr Biteko as the new minister for Minerals two weeks ago replacing Ms Angellah Kairuki, who had been transferred to the newly formed Ministry of Investment. Speaking in Dar es Salaam on Thursday at a meeting with mining officers from various regions in the country, Mr Biteko called for efficiency. Mr Biteko, who was speaking in Dar es Salaam yesterday with all mining officers in the country, had directed them to increase efficiency and shun corrupt practices to improve the sector. "I want you (mining officers) to discharge your duties with high efficiency and integrity to improve the sector and shun corrupt practices … I assure you that the ministry will continue expelling officers, who will not abide by the code of ethics,” he insisted. He advised all mining officers to cooperate with regional security committees, which comprised regional commissioner, regional administrative secretaries and district commissioners to improve the sector and increase revenue collection. Mr Biteko called on the permanent secretary in the ministry to ensure all challenges related to the performance of officers, including a limited budget, were addressed. The minister said plans were underway to establish mining centres in all regions in the country to expand the sector and increase revenue. "On Saturday, we are expected to meet with all regional commissioners in Dodoma Region. We want to discuss how we will establish mining centres and how to improve the sector in the country," Mr Biteko explained. He urged minerals officers to ensure all views given by mining stakeholders were taken on board and challenges addressed to improve the sector in the country.
