THE world is currently experiencing more serious refugee problem than ever since the Second World War (WW II). According to a report by the World Refugees Council (WRC), the number of refugees has escalated to 68.5 million, globally. Former Tanzania President Jakaya Kikwete (pictured) , presenting the report before the United Nations in New York recently, described service to refugees as an international responsibility and humanitarian act. Dr Kikwete who co-chairs the WRC said it is highly surprising to see some developed countries refusing to honour “these responsibilities” at the expense of poor countries. He said the council received the Tanzanian government position on the World Bank proposal to have Tanzania acquiring a loan to support refugees. “Tanzania was asked toapply the loan from the World Bank for the refugee services notwithstanding that the country has its own loans that it acquired for various development projects,” he said. Dr Kikwete argued that the Tanzanian government believes that serving refugees is the humanitarian responsibility, which is supposed to be shouldered internationally.The report indicates that out of the 68.5 million refugees, three million have lost homes due to climatic changes due to environmental degradation. There has been an increase of refugees in the Southern Sahara Africa, the report says, adding that in 2017 the number reached 18.4 million compared to 14.1 million of 2015. The report shows that 79 per cent of refugees come from Somalia, Nigeria, South Sudan and Central Africa Republic (CAR). It also highlights countries that receive many refugees as Uganda with 1.4 million, Ethiopia (900,000), Tanzania (326,000) and Rwanda (84,000). The report explains that some countries like US, Canada, Australia and Finland have also taken some refugees but in small numbers. The council offered suggestions to bolster efforts to address the problem, insisting on peace and security as well as setting strategies to resolve disputes.
