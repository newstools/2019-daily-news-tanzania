The Higher Education Students’ Loan Board (HESLB) has identifies a total of 12,612 past loans beneficiaries within just six months, thanks to its loans recovery efforts, including a crackdown it has been conducting across the country. Presenting the performance of the board for the first half of the 2018/2019 financial year starting from June to December 31, last year to Members of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Social Services and Community Development yesterday in Dodoma, HESLB’s Executive Director, Mr Abdul-Razaq Badru, said the total number of identified beneficiaries had now reached 207,319. However, he said out of the identified number of past beneficiaries, a total of 198,659 were already repaying the loans. According to the HESLB leadership, the success in the loan recovery process had been largely facilitated by cooperation between the board and strategic stakeholders such as Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA), Tanzania Private Sector Foundation (TPSF), President’s Office Public Service Management and pensions funds. Other contributing factors include amendment to the HESLB Act that increased the rate of the deduction rate from eight to 15 per cent from an employee’s gross salary, employers’ compliance on loan reimbursement and publicising the list of past beneficiaries followed by close follow-ups to their employers. Mr Badru said in the 2017/18 financial year, HESLB identified 50,754 past beneficiaries, of whom 43,019 started paying back loans in the same year while the remaining number started reimbursing loans this financial year. He said since the HESLB started its operations in 2006/2007 financial year up to December 31, last year, a total of 492.23bn/- had been recovered from past beneficiaries, which is 63 per cent of the set target of 784bn/-. The report presented by Mr Badru yesterday to the Committee members shows that over the past six months, the board had collected a total of 94.01bn/-. Speaking on loan disbursement to students in the 2018/2019 academic year, HESLB Director of Loans Allocations and Disbursement Dr Veronica Nyahende, said in the first six months of 2018/2019 financial year, HESLB gave loans to a total of 119,214 students amounting to 421.4bn/-, 40,114 of whom were first year students. According to Dr Nyahende, 81,425 first year students filled in loans application forms and after processing the applications, 57,000 of them qualified for the funds but due to budget constraints, the loans were allocated to 40,000 of them. Committee members such as Suzan Lyimo, Hawa Ghasia and Committee Chairman who doubles and Kigoma North MP Peter Serukamba, implored the HESLB management and the ministry in general to devise a strategy of educating the public on how to fill in the forms. The Committee members made the call after it was revealed that about 25,000 students who filled in the forms for the 2018/2019 academic year had several anomalies. They also asked HESLB to involve the committee whenever it found it necessary to change the criteria for loan allocation to students.
