JAKAYA Kikwete Cardiac Institute (JKCI) intends to advance to heart transplant after mastering different types of surgeries since its establishment. Heart transplant is the surgery to remove a person’s infected heart and replace it with a healthy heart from a dead person. Most patients referred to heart transplant centres have end-stage heart failure. Experts say how long the patient may live after the transplant depends on many factors, including age, general health and response to the transplant. “Our expectation is to reach a stage of offering heart transplant services in future,” said JKCI’s Director of Cardiology Services Dr Peter Kisenge. He made the statement in Dar es Salaam recently while speaking to the Public Relations Officers from institutions under the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elders and Children. Milliman Consulting firm, which tallies the average costs of different organ transplants in the US says while the kidney transplant costs over 400,000 US dollars (over 920m/-), the heart transplant averagely costs 1.4 million dollars (over 3.2bn/-). Dr Kisenge further said the institute has made many achievements in the past three years since President John Magufuli assumed office. The public relations officers were at the JKCI to document the achievements as part of their programme to expose the successes of various institutions under the ministry towards improvement of the health sector. During the past three years, the institute managed serving 7,000 patients monthly, with Dr Kisenge noting that heart diseases were increasing as a result of life styles. During the corresponding period, JKCI enabled the government to save at least 72bn/- which it could have spent in treatment of heart patients abroad. The cost of treating heart patients overseas is four times more costly than doing it within the country. While it costs about 16m/- for the heart surgery in India, the same procedure costs 4m/- at JKCI.
