THE region is set to host a major forum on reducing the rate of youth unemployment in the country. Scheduled for July this year, the gathering will feature more than 800 participants drawn from different cadres. Organised by Kilimanjaro based higher learning institutions and colleges, the forum will also bring together academicians, religious leaders, politicians and public servants to discuss ways of unlocking youth potential in addressing unemployment. “Participants in the forum will have opportunities to go through papers and recommendations presented by Kilimanjaro District Commissioners,” explained Mr Samwel Kamandwa, one of the forum’s organisers while briefing members of the press yesterday. According to Mr Kamandwa, other issues that will come up for discussion during the forum include the establishment and development of industries and the crucial role they stand to play towards youth employment. He further disclosed that a seminar and special training for youth leaders from the ruling CCM party will be held as a precursor to the much awaited forum. “The seminar will be held early next month,” he said. Speaking here recently, Kilimanjaro Regional Commissioner, Anna Mghwira noted that the fifth phase government under the leadership of President John Pombe Magufuli was determined to revive seven out of 20 industries that had collapsed in the region. The industries that are up for revival include Africado, Kilimanjaro Furniture Ltd, Kilimanjaro Machine Tools Ltd, Leather Industry, Ginger Factory and Kibo Match Ltd. Tanzania is currently undertaking some massive projects as part of efforts to improve infrastructure for the envisaged industrial economy.
