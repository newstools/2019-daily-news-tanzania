FOREIGN Affairs and East African Cooperation Minister Dr Augustine Mahiga has tasked the Centre for Foreign Relations (CFR) to link the issues in the country’s industrialization agenda with the economic diplomacy course it conducts. He argued that the move would help produce graduates who would contribute to the government’s efforts to elevate the country to middle income economy status through industries by 2025. “As of now the centre should be at the forefront to help the government by teaching courses that are in line with the current economic transformation,” he stated when officiating the 21st graduation ceremony of the CFR at the weekend. He challenged the management to come up with plans that would enable the college produce graduates with required skills in the area of economic diplomacy. The CFR’s director, Dr Bernard Achiula, explained that the college was the only one offering economic diplomacy course in the country. “We offer the course to support the Fifth Phase Government in implementing its policy to enable the country reach middle-income economy status by 2025,” Dr Achiula remarked. In a new development, the centre plans to offer training on economic diplomacy to government officials in ministries, regional and district commissioners as well as heads of public institutions and private sector companies. Meanwhile, from this year, the college will introduce peace studies and conflict management basing on the Tanzania’s history in resolving conflicts.
