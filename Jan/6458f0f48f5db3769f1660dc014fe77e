THE shilling remained fairly stable last year despite global fiery currencies storm depreciating by 2.2 per cent but tipped to open the year on a strong-note. Orbit Securities Market Analyst Imani Muhingo said the shilling managed to cling on stableness due to increased foreign reserves boosted by tourism and bumper harvest. The shilling fairly stability was “due to increased foreign reserves from a growing tourism sector by roughly 15 per cent 2017/2018, growing mining exports and bumper harvests in 2017,” Mr Muhingo said in end year market analysis. His analysis showed that Kenyan shilling gained 0.6 per cent while Ugandan shilling lost 2.08 per cent and South African rand lost more than 17 per cent up to mid- December last year. The Bank of Tanzania reported in mid-last year that exports revenues mainly from resources and commodities stood at 240million US dollars up from 171million US dollars in 2017. CRDB Bank on its Daily Market Highlights said that the shilling made some gains on the last day of trading in last year thanks to low demand of the US dollar. However, the bank said “we anticipate the local unit to start the New Y ear on the strong side”. CRDB cautioned that “demand will be expected to bring some pressure to the shilling as business resume after the festival season”. Up to last year mid- September some currencies faced significant depreciation against the US dollar namely Argentina’s peso fell 121 per cent, Turkey’s lira clear-fell 80 per cent, Brazil’s real down 30per cent and Iran’s rial fell 30per cent. Other worse hit currencies were Mynmar’s kyat fell 20per cent, Ethiopia’s birr depreciated 18 per cent, Russia’s ruble fell 16per cent and India’s rupee went down 12per cent just to mention a few. The worst hit was Venezuela’s bolivar which depreciated by about 2.5million per cent up to last August when the government had to revalue the currency 100,000 to 1US dollar.
