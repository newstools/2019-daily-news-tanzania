Buoyed by the arrival of their new coach, Arusha based outfit AFC will be looking to put to an end their poor run of the league when they entertain Boma FC from Mbeya at the Sheikh Amri Abeid Stadium, tomorrow. Still reeling from series of a lackluster performance, the Arusha-based outfit will be hoping to make amends this week, having hired the services of Coach Madaraka Bendera to replace David Nyambele in the ongoing First Division League(FDL). In an interview with the ‘Daily News’ yesterday, AFC Spokesperson Ally Shemdoe exuded confidence that his team will get back to winning ways after a slow start to the New year. He said the team had to part ways with Nyambele following a poor run of form, saying their new tactician will hit the ground running as he assumes his new responsibilities. “We all know Bendera’s track record having coached Simba in his heydays, we are confident that we will defeat Boma this weekend,” boasted Mr Shemdoe. He, however, had kind words for Nyambele for playing an integral part in the signing of some of their crucial players throughout his tenure. Shemdoe said the Arusha outfit face an uphill climb to make it to the Premier League, making a passionate appeal to Arusha residents to support them. “At the moment we are 13 points adrift the league leaders and clearly shows the hard work we have to put in catching up with them,” he added. AFC’s Secretary General, Fredrick Lymo thanked the office of the Regional Commissioner, Mrisho Gambo for according the team necessary support. Lymo commended the RC’s zeal of seeing AFC and Arusha United getting promoted to the Premier League next season.
