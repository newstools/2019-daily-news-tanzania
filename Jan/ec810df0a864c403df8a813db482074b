TANZANIA has enough food reserve to cater for all citizens and remain with a three million tonnes surplus, Agriculture Minister Japhet Hasunga said here yesterday. Mr Hasunga said the country has the Self Sufficiency Ratio (SSR) of 124 per cent, adding that during the 2018/2019 farming season the country’s demand was pegged at 13,569,285 tonnes. “As per the country’s demand, we have an excess of 3,013,515 tonnes,’’ Mr Hasunga told reporters, boasting that Tanzania was currently the food reservoir for the neighbouring countries, thanks to high food production. He said as per Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) statistics, between June 2017 and June 2018, 64,477.95 tonnes of maize valued at 90.6bn/- and 99,434.45 tonnes of beans valued at 222bn/- were exported to DRC, Rwanda, Burundi, Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan and United Arab Emirates. Mr Hasunga said between 2015/2016 and 2017/2018, cash crops production increased as well. At the press conference, the minister explained that the use of the best cotton seeds increased from 14,500 tonnes in 2015/2016 to 18,500 tonnes in 2017/2018, adding that in 2018/2019 the use was expected to increase to 25,000 tonnes. “Until now we have already distributed 27,769 tonnes, equivalent to 37 per cent more than the requested amount of 20,284 tonnes,” he said. He said cashew nuts were currently produced in 17 regions and 90 different districts, thanks to the inception of a robust plan to increase production of the cash crop during the 2013/2014 financial year. According to the minister, the leading cashew nut producing regions are Mtwara, Lindi, Ruvuma, Coast and Tanga, with new entrants joining the league recently. The new entrants include Singida, Dodoma, Morogoro, Mbeya and Njombe. Mr Hasunga said a recent verification report on payment of cashew nut cooperative unions indicated that 450 unions had been paid as of last December, with the verified bank payment being 231.9bn/- while the money disbursed to farmers amounted to 210.5bn/-. On sugar imports, the minister said the government had sealed all loopholes for illegal importation to stabilise the local market. “This initiative has increased sugar production from 293,075 tonnes in 2015/2016 to 307,431.14 tonnes in 2017/2018 and we expect production to increase to 352,600 in 2018/2019,’’he explained. The minister further said the sugar sector was providing indirect jobs to 57,000 people as well as 75,000 other employment opportunities in the sugar plantations and factories.
