RESIDENTS of Shinyanga Municipal Council have appealed to investors to invest in commuter bus business after the construction of various roads at tarmac level. The introduction of commuter buses will replace bicycles and motorcycles, which have been used as means of transport in the area. Tanzania Road Agency Development Service (Tanroads) and Tanzania Rural and Urban Road Agency (Tarura) in Shinyanga Region have been praised for infrastructural improvement. It has been reported that most investors do not invest in Shinyanga due to lack of wellconstructed roads. The good work of Tanroads and Tarura in the municipal council has opened a new chapter for the region. The residents will be able to move from one place to another using commuter buses. Tanroads Regional Chief Planning Officer Ferdinand Mdoe said the municipal council had 48km roads. He noted that all kilometres had been covered at tarmac level. “We invite transporters and other investors to the region. Shinyanga is now a home of businesses. We have solved several challenges by improving our roads,” he said. The regional Tanroads boss said the improvement of road network would help boost businesses in the region. Tarura Regional Assistant Kulwa Maige said his office was doing everything in its capacity to ensure all roads were passable all the time.
