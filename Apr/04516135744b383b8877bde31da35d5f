CASH payments to the National Environment Management Council (NEMC) will now be made only electronically, the council announced recently. The Director of Finance and Administration, Mr Charles Wangwe, said the new system took effect starting March 28. All payments must now be made through the government electronic payment (GePG) system, and the payer must first get a payment control number to facilitate payment to NEMC’s accounts maintained at CRDB Bank (0150005055800) and National Microfinance Bank [NMB] (201100024189). The director emphasised that payments should not be made directly to the council’s bank accounts, explaining that the payer must first get a payment control number generated from the GePG system. Payers wishing to get clarification can visit NEMC offices at Mikocheni, in Dar es Salaam or call on 0677 069967. Previously, money for NEMC was handled manually, the director said, noting that some of it was lost along the way. The new system eliminates all the risks and inconveniences payers used to get because of physical money payment procedures, he said, explaining that money due to the council will now reach the council on time. He called on NEMC stakeholders to pay fees and levies on time and as stipulated in the Environment Management Act 2004. “Defaulters will be fined or deregistered as the case may be. Those struck from the books will have to re-apply for registration,” he said
