MORE than 50 participants from the private sector, banks, legal firms, academia and the public sector gathered in Dar es Salaam this week, to share their feedback on the proposed 2019 edition of the World Bank’s Contractual Provisions for Public-private Partnerships (PPPs). “This is a guidance note meant to help governments prepare PPPs that deliver much-needed infrastructure and public services,” said Christina Paul, Senior Counsel for the World Bank. “The Guidance explains how governments can protect their rights while ensuring the reasonable rights of their private partners.” The complexity of PPPs frequently means that considerable time and expense is involved in preparing and finalising PPP contracts. To make the contractual drafting process quicker and less expensive, many countries— and especially those with well-established PPP programmes— have undertaken efforts to standardise the provisions in such contracts. According to the World Bank Group’s 2018 Procuring Infrastructure PPPs Report, 52 out of 135 surveyed countries developed at least one model contract and/or standardised document applicable to PPP transactions. To assist contracting authorities in developing and emerging markets to prepare PPP contract clauses in line with international good practice and standards, the World Bank initially developed the Guidance on PPP Contractual Provisions, 2017 edition, which focused on eight critical contractual provisions that are most essential for a project’s bankability and are found in virtually every PPP contract. The 2017 edition is now being updated, taking into consideration stakeholder feedback that was received after its publication. The draft document has been shared for public consultations and is accessible on the World Bank’s consultation page.
