PRIME Minister Kassim Majaliwa has instructed Regional and District Commissioners to educate their officers over small entrepreneurs who are supposed to get identification cards as per the directive by President John Magufuli. Recently, President Magufuli directed all petty traders and small entrepreneurs to be issued with identity cards in efforts to formalise them and allow them to pay taxes so that they can also contribute to the country’s development. However, the National Assembly heard here yesterday that in some parts of the country, officials are not sure of the type of small entrepreneurs who are supposed to get the identification cards.Mbozi legislator, Pascal Haonga (CHADEMA) said the exercise was chaotic in some areas because the officials issued the identity cards to small traders, even those selling vegetables in the streets. Mr Haonga sought for the Prime Minister’s intervention to clarify on the type of petty traders who are supposed to get the cards. Reacting to his question, Mr Majaliwa explained that the president’s decision to introduce the identification cards had good intentions of recognizing the latter and make them part of contributors to the national income. The cards were also intended to make them avoid harassment from local authorities who, on several occasions, have been evicting them from areas where they run their activities. Entrepreneurs are categorised into three groups, namely small, middle and big entrepreneurs. But, according to the Prime Minister, the identification cards targeted the small traders whose annual turnover does not exceed 4m/-.
