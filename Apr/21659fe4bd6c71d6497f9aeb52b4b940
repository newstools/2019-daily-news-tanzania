THE Speaker of the National Assembly Job Ndugai has warned Members of Parliament (MPs) of impregnating women and abandoning them without providing care for their new-born babies. "I have certain correspondences of some mothers from all corners of the country, complaining about MPs, who have abandoned their children. I ask everyone, who is responsible for that to take action," he told the MPs on Wednesday. The Speaker was giving an additional answer to that ofÂ  the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Kangi Lugola, who was responding to a lawmaker, who asked about foreigners given temporary employment in the country, but impregnated girls and abandoned them without care, when returning to their home countries. Mr Ndugai said: "There is a day I will come with the list here. It will be a disaster." In his question, Ms Tauhida Gallos (Special Seats-CCM), wanted to know the government's strategy on such foreigners.
