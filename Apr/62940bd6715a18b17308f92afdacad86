THE Arusha United Football Team, which recently changed ownership, reverting back to where it originated from, the army, also changed arenas for their last weekend’s match against Dodoma FC , choosing to play far away in Dar-essalaam. Team officials said the team was receiving threats, including obscene phone calls from unknown people who have been threatening to send hooligans to beat up players before the game. Initially, Arusha United were supposed to face Dodoma FC at the Sheikh Amri Abeid Stadium in Arusha, but shifted venue to the Major General Michael Isamuyo grounds at Mbweni National Service base, in Dar-es-salaam. Essentially Arusha could have been the team’s home ground, but since Arusha United was recently taken back by the National Service (JKT) Oljoro Base, even the Mbweni venue of Dar, served as ‘home ground,’ for the team, which however only managed a draw match of 1-1 against Dodoma. It was a rather tough run, because the first score was managed in the 88th minute, just two minutes before the final whistle was blown and the goal was on Dodoma’s favour having been scored by James Mendi, whose powerful shot proved to be too hot for Arusha United’s goalkeeper, Shaibu Issa to handle. But, the Arusha United team, managed to level the score in the 90th minute, just seconds before the referee ended the match. Yusuph Mgwao is credited with the goal which saved his team from fall. With such results, the Arusha United FC remain in the 5th position of the Group B fixture of the ongoing First Division League, having amassed 29 points. The team is expected to play against Mgambo Shooting next Saturday on April 20th during the Easter Weekend. “We are getting ready for Mgambo Shooting,” said the Arusha United Coach, Emmanuel Massawe, who admitted that the match against Dodoma FC was tougher than he anticipated. He explained that, the team was forced to move venues after some of his players received threatening and obscene phone calls.
