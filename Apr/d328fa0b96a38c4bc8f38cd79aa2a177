JPM, who is the Commander in-Chief of the armed forces, commissioned 146 graduates from the Monduli-based Tanzania Military Academy (TMA), in the event held at the State House. “It was fortunate to learn that President also closely follows golf, I had never thought he knew about our existence and the game altogether,” he noted. Luwongo added he was very pleased to learn that President Magufuli understands and follow closely the game. “President asked “how is golf going ,” I was wondering what to say, but I replied “golf is doing very well,” he added. The, chairman, who started to take golf lesson just recently, said apart from sporting benefits, golf gives a golfer a cure of stresses through partnership and a long walk to cover all 18 holes. Luwongo, who was the chief guest at the event, also awarded the national team ace Richard Mtweve with a Division A title. Organised by Lugalo Club, the annual ninehole event was very challenging, but Mtweve still beat rest to win the top prize. Impressively, Mtweve netted 33 strokes to beat Darbased Malawian pilot, Captain Peter Fiwa by three strokes. Fiwa, who in a sparking form, carded 36 nett to finish second in the highly competitive event.
