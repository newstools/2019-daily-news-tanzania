KEY players in the gaming industry have requested the government to abolish the winning tax in a bid to unlock the sector’s potential and spur the economy. Tanzania Sports Betting Association (TSBA) has pleaded with the government to focus on collecting taxes through the gross gaming revenues instead. TSBA Chairman Jimmy Keneth said that winning tax waiver would offer operators breathing space to attract responsible customers and grow their businesses and spur the economy. TGB data shows an upsurge on tax collections between 2012/2013 and 2017/2018 from the industry when revenue jumped from Sh11.4 billion to Sh79.1 billion, registering a 606 per cent increase during the period under review. “Despite this massive contribution, there are increasing concerns over the government’s approach of taxing the sports betting, inadvertently hurting and inhibiting the industry’s impressive potential for growth,” Mr Keneth said. The existing fiscal regime impedes the core business model of operators in the industry, he observed. TGB and Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) substantially reduce prospective payouts when they tax winners, TSBA chief complained. The Winnings Tax actually punishes players willing to bet through legitimate channels, he said. “The reduced earnings from winnings dissuade players from betting through licenced operators, persuading them to migrate to unregistered and unlicenced platforms where they can capture their entire winnings,” he said.
