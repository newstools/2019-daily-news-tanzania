FEARING surprise from Simba in their return leg of CAF Champions league match in Lubumbashi, TP Mazembe president Pamphile Mihayo now banks on the fans support against the Tanzanian threat. Simba who play hosts TP Mazembe on Saturday (tomorrow), denied the Congolese giants their usual double victory tag, they used to post in their past meetings with Tanzanian clubs. The barren draw with Simba sent shockwaves in Lubumbashi as the barren draw forces TP Mazembe to avoid conceding a goal at their home venue. The club’s boss was quoted in the club’s website urging people to flock at the stadium to support their team saying their support would help their team over come the Simba threat. “It is a big match that TP Mazembe fans should not miss since their presence will motivate much our players,” said Mihayo. He said the sales of the tickets officially started yesterday, three days prior to the clash. Mihayo urged TP Mazembe supporters not to wait until Saturday since by then there won’t be a ticket available. Confident Tanzanian envoys are heading for a big surprise and through the team captain, John Bocco, the abrupt change of match referees won’t affect them psychologically. Bocco said the change of referees who were initially picked to officiate their return leg CAF Champions League match against TP Mazembe on Saturday will not affect them from getting good results. Recently, CAF replaced all the referees who were first picked to be in charge of the reverse match in Lubumbashi on what they claimed to be technical reasons
