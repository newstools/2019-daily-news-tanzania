LOCAL Government Authorities (LGAs) have been asked to enact bylaws that will reinforce placements of residential addresses and Post Code programmes currently ongoing in different stages of implementation countrywide. The directive was emphasized on Monday by the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communications responsible for the Communications sector Deputy Permanent Secretary, Dr Jim Yonazi, while in an official tour to inspect the implementation of the ambitious programme. While at the Mwanza City Council (MCC) and Ilemela Municipal Council, Dr Yonazi expressed his satisfaction at the stages the Municipalities have reached in implementing the programme, and called for efficient enabling environment for them to progress further. “We are glad that Mwanza Region particularly these two Municipalities are progressing relatively well in implementing this programme, which is very important for social, economic, peace and security of the people,” he pointed out. According to the Deputy PS, effective implementation of the programme will also reveal the citizens’ identities, where all their particulars will be filled in the National Identification Cards, adding that “for instance this will be harmonized to accommodate all their information sourced from the residential addresses and post codes.” Dr Yonazi said the bylaws will make sure that infrastructures installed by different local government authorities will benefit members of their communities, and hence safeguarded.
