THE government will continue cracking the whip on economic saboteurs and dishonest public servants as a way of honouring the late Edward Moringe Sokoine. Speaking here yesterday, Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa was categorical that the current government will not relent in its quest of fighting corruption in treasuring the nononsensical approach the late premier used in dealing with economic saboteurs. “We will continue to hold Sokoine dear to our hearts, especially honoring what he had done in fighting corruption in the country,” said the Premier after flagging off the Sokoine Memorial Marathon at the Sheikh Amri Abeid Memorial Stadium. Mr Majaliwa described the late Sokoine as a straightforward leader who showed no mercy on economic saboteurs during his heydays. “The late Sokoine dedicated much of his life in instilling discipline among civil servants and ensured each Tanzanian was treated equally,” said the Premier. He added that the government will continue embracing his ideals in waging war against economic saboteurs. Mr Sokoine was a household name when the country was experiencing an acute shortage of basic necessities, as few ‘greedy individuals’ were deliberately hiding goods for people to scramble for them at exorbitant prices. Such were the days when corruption was at its peak; with many ordinary Tanzanians living a miserable life bearing the brunt of the economic saboteurs. He died on April 12, 1984 in a car crash at Dakawa area in Morogoro, while returning from Dodoma where he had addressed the parliament. The late Premier’s daughter, Ms Namalok Sokoine thanked the government for improving the welfare of Tanzanians through the provision of basic social services. “My late father was known for helping the poor, he had dedicated 50 per cent of his salary and other earnings to the less privileged,” she said. The annual Sokoine Marathon is organised by the late Prime Minister’s family in honour of the man revered for his firm actions.
