TO get rid of deaths as a result of Malaria infections, Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) has joined efforts with National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) as a partner organisation in promoting ‘Zero Malaria starts with me’ campaign. Making the revelation recently IHI Chief Executive Director (CEO), Dr Honorati Masanja said his institution focuses on empowering communities to take ownership of malaria prevention and care. This development comes as different countries in the world commemorated World Malaria Day last week, where according to the W HO’s latest report focusing on 2015- 2017 globally, still there are no signs of gains in reducing malaria cases. However, WHO indicates that between 2017 and 2018, the world witnessed around 435,000 deaths as a result of the killer disease, hence calling for additional intervention strategies. Dr Masanja said in a press statement prepared for Malaria control in the city that, IHI believes that tools like mosquito-proofed housing systems should be prioritized in the communities, and Sub- Saharan Africa to take control of the disease. Dr Masanja further said that window screening, and covering of windows or roof space with materials which can allow free flowing of air, but prevent insects such as mosquitoes, should be advocated for in physical protection to human beings. “Findings from our study published on the Lancet Plenary Health last month which included re-analyses of the previously collected Malaria cases in Dar es Salaam found that increasing coverage of complete window screening was associated with reduced bites of mosquitoes, and resulted in Malaria cases and decline from 28 per cent in 2004 to less than two per cent, four years later,” IHI press statement said.
