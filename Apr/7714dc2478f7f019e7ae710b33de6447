SIMBA maintained their record breaking in filling the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam to the brim as once again fans decorated the venue with red and white colours yesterday. The weather in the beautiful city of Dar es Salaam was moderate with chances of downpour 50-50 but that was not enough to halt thousands of sports fans who flocked at the venue to witness Simba entertaining TP Mazembe in the first leg of CAF Champions League quarter finals. Basing on the impact of this match especially at this stage, a massive win by Simba would do them good ahead of the reverse action in DR Congo next weekend, whose overall winner earns a ticket of stepping into the last four. Arriving at the 60,000 capacity venue as early as 10:00am, the atmosphere outside had already started to boil up as scores of people mainly those who use this chance to earn money through selling various food and nonfood products were busy putting their things at designated places readying to satisfy the incoming fans. In most cases, whenever a big match of this nature is played, food sellers are the ones who benefit a lot because some people eat both breakfast and lunch there since they simply would not want to miss anything. Also, ticket sellers positioned themselves at different points around the venue to simply sell the tickets in advance. By 2:00pm, the number of people seeking tickets tripled thereby creating chaos in the process. And, an hour later the venue was almost filled to the brim with Simba fans chanting and enjoying each and every moment.
