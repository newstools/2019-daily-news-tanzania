AN Endakiso villager in Babati District, Manyara Region, Ms Dori Joshua (20), has been arrested by the police for allegedly stealing a one-day baby at Babati District Hospital (Mrara). Manyara Regional Police Commander (RPC), Augustine Senga said the young woman allegedly took the baby from her mother Ms Hawa Msangi (39), while in a Bajaj that they were travelling in from the hospital to Babati Township. The RPC explained Ms Joshua convinced Ms Msangi that they should use the same Bajaj to town for the sake of sharing costs. Then, she asked the mother to carry the baby and after arriving in Sinai, she asked to drop so that she takes money from a person in the area. She happened to go with the baby and then disappeared. The police were informed about the incident, started investigating and established that she went by motorcycle to home village, Endakiso. Police officers called at the village and were able to arrest her and got the baby back to her mother. The suspect was outside a house, while the baby was made to sleep inside one of the rooms. It is alleged that she had planned to take the baby to show her fianc√©, who for some months she had been telling him that she was pregnant, so that she could be assisted with some money. The RPC urged women to be careful after delivery, as there were some people out there to steal babies. He also warned all those engaging in a similar criminal activity.
