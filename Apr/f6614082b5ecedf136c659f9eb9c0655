THE Impala Group of Hotels is now considering instituting a lawsuit against Exim Bank Tanzania and Locus Attorneys over a huge debt allegations levelled against them. The decision comes a day after the management of Exim Bank issued a public notice to distance themselves from such allegations. A statement released by the financial institution yesterday denied claims that they had picked one, Dr Onesmo Kyauke, from Locus Attorneys to facilitate the auctioning of Impala chains of hotels, which include Ngurdoto Mountain Lodge, Naura Springs and Impala Hotel over the unspecified debt. But in a telephone interview with the ‘Daily News’ yesterday, Impala Group of Hotels Managing Director, Rando Mrema said they were intending to sue the two parties for defamation. Mr Mrema said such allegations had affected their business at the luxurious hotels’ facilities. “We have consulted our lawyers. So, we will file a lawsuit against the two parties for tarnishing our image and affecting our business,” emphasised Mr Mrema, who is also a son of Mr Faustine Meleo Auye Mrema, the founder of the Impala Group of Hotels. Without disclosing when they were intending to do so, Mr Mrema insisted that they would demand an apology and compensation over the damage on their business. “My office was shocked upon seeing such reports on social media. We hope to issue an official statement to counteract the bizarre allegations,” he added. According to Mr Mrema, the Impala Group of Hotels has no business engagement with Exim Bank or anyone from Locus Attorneys. On Wednesday, a section of local media reported on possibilities of the Impala Hotels getting auctioned over the undisclosed bank debt.
