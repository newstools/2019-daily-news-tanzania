YOUNG Africans Head Coach Mwinyi Zahera said they have to blame themselves for failing to pocket vital three points against Ndanda FC on Thursday at Nangwanda Sijaona Stadium in Mtwara. Yanga came from a goal down to force a 1-1 draw on the day and are slowly loosening their grip at the top of the Mainland Premier League, hence giving advantage to their main challengers Azam FC and defending champions Simba SC to catch them. It was the Congolese midfielder Papy Tshishimbi, who salvaged a point for his side after winning a free header in the 61st minute from Kelvin Yondani cross and consequently cancelled out Vitalisy Mayanga’s 20th minute opener. The Jangwani Street outfit has failed to collect possible six points from past two league games and instead have just bagged one point. It all started with a 1-0 setback they suffered at Samora Stadium in Iringa from Lipuli FC, before being held to a draw by Ndanda. Speaking after the tense match, Zahera said his side failed to use the minimal goal scoring chances they created in both halves. “We have to blame ourselves for the poor results. The goal we conceded in the first half was our own mistake which was partly contributed by poor pitch,” Zahera said. He added that the match referee was perfect and controlled the game well, denying claims that the first penalty his side was awarded was not real.
