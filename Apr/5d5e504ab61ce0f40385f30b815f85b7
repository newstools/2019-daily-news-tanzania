PUBLIC Service Social Security Fund (PSSSF) has, by February this year, paid a total of 888.3bn/- to retirees. The payment was made to a total of 9,971 retirees who were members of the former Public Service Pension Fund (PSPF), the MPs were told in Dodoma on Tuesday. The Deputy Minister of State in the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office responsible for Policy, Parliamentary Affairs, Labour, Employment, Youth and the Disabled, Mr Anthony Mavunde stated this during the question-answer session. Mbozi MP Paschal Haonga (CHADEMA) claimed in Parliament that there were civil servants in many district councils who were members of the PSPF, but are not yet paid their pensions since they retired over a year ago. Mr Haonga further argued that there was speculation that the government has misused the funds of the former PSPF by lending them to
some individuals and institutions. However, Mr Mavunde clarified that the PSSSF has completed putting in place a payment system which would enable it make payments at regional level. Full report will be published in the Daily News on Wednesday.
