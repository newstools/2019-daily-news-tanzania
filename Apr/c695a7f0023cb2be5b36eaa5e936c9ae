PRESIDENT John Magufuli yesterday issued a stern warning to leaders collaborating with poachers who have been gunning down wild animals, including elephants in Selous Game Reserve, insisting that their days are numbered. Speaking during the inauguration of Namtumbo-Kilimasera, Matemanga-Tunduru road in Tunduru District yesterday, he said poachers from outside the country were also collaborating with those within the country. “Do not be deceived, I know the whole circle, as some of the poachers are collaborating with some officials from Selous Game Reserve,” said President Magufuli. He further said poachers in the country kill elephants and transport the tusks to their accomplices in neighbouring country and vice versa. The head of state said he had information about individuals involving themselves in poaching activities. However, he could not divulge more details about such individuals and leaders. President Magufuli said the head of Selous Game Reserve should be alert as the area was very crucial to the country. The Selous Game Reserve is a protected area in southern Tanzania. It covers a total area of 50,000 km² and has additional buffer zones. It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982 due to its wildlife diversity and undisturbed nature. The fifth phase government under President John Magufuli intensified the war against poaching since he was voted to power in 2015 by taking legal measures against those found involved in poaching. The government’s conservation campaign is reportedly bearing fruit, with the number of elephants and other endangered wild animals going up. Africa continues to struggle with declining wildlife as many species are being hunted towards extinction. Sustainability and conservation are essential to Africa’s future.
