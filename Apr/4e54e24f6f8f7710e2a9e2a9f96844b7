KISARAWE District Commissioner, Ms Jokate Mwengelo has thanked education stakeholders and the ‘ wananchi’ for their support in raising funds for construction of girls’ secondary school to be built in the district soon. Ms Mwegelo said that district received over 900m/- cash and pledges in a fundraising organised by the District under her campaign dubbed “Tokomeza zero” late last month. She said the district has received 80.64m/- in cash and building facilities under the campaign to build a special girl’s secondary school in Kibuta Ward in the District. “On behalf of the government of Kisarawe District, I highly thank all the education stakeholders, government leaders and the public that supported us in raising the funds to facilitate the construction of girls’ secondary,” she said. She said the District target was to collect 1.3bn/- to construct six dormitories at the cost of 160m/-, labaratories 70m/- and classes 120m/-. The DC said the District continues to receive more funds, facilities and other needs needed to facilitate the construction of the school. She said among the pledges she received was the construction of two dormitories, science laboratories and classes. Commenting on the campaign the District Executive Director Mr Mussa Gama said the plan is long term strategy that the District has had but failed to mature due to lack of funds to build the school. He said the aim of having the plan in line is to help raise the education status for girls in the District. According to the report issued many girls in the District fail to complete their educational journey due to lack of dormitories and other supporting materials. “For instance, in between 2014 and 2017 the District had 4880 girls who completed form four but only 66 managed to make it to form five and six,” said the DC.
