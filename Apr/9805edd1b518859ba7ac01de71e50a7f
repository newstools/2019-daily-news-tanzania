INVESTORS and farmers in southern regions of Tanzania have hailed President John Magufuli for attracting investments and pushing for removing bureaucracy that frustrates investors, who want to start industries in Tanzania. Wood Foundation Chairman Sir Ian Wood said President Magufuli’s public condemnation of bureaucracy was evidence that he was determined to end bureaucracy that frustrated prospective investors in industries and curtailed the pace of investment in the country. Sir Ian also said the Wood Foundation would continue working closely with the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (Sagcot), noting that impressive agricultural reforms currently being witnessed in southern regions were a result of Sagcot’s good coordination. “Sagcot has proved to be an important link between us. Being one of the partners, we will continue working closely with Sagcot,” he pledged. A Njombe avocado grower, Mr Christom Mkole, praised the industrialisation drive in Ihemi Cluster, which was being spearheaded by Sagcot with support of the President. “Kabambe Tea Factory, which was been launched by President Magufuli, is a catalyst for tea growers. It guarantees them a reliable and permanent market,” he said. Sagcot Chief Executive Officer, Geoffrey Kirenga said Sagcot had been happy to witness two new factories opened by President Magufuli in 12 months. The President opened Silverlands Factory that produces chicken feeds and has a huge hatchery recently opened Kabambe Tea Factory. Mr Kirenga said President Magufuli was a practical person and made consistent follow-ups on development projects. He said the factories opened in Sagcot gave the investment drive a fresh push. Mr Kirenga called on experts to visit Sagcot to see for themselves public private partnership (PPP) at work and see the contribution of the private sector to farmers.
