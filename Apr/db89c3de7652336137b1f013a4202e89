Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange has been arrested at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, BBC reports. Assange took refuge in the embassy seven years ago to avoid extradition to Sweden over a sexual assault case that has since been dropped. The Met Police said he was arrested for failing to surrender to the court. BBC quoted Ecuador's president Lenin Moreno saying his country “withdrew Mr Assange's asylum after his repeated violations of international conventions.” But Wikileaks tweeted that Ecuador had acted illegally in terminating Mr Assange's political asylum "in violation of international law". BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale was quoted as saying “over the years they have removed his access to the internet and accused him of engaging in political activities - which is not allowed when claiming asylum.” He said: "Precisely what has happened in the embassy is not clear - there has been claim and counter claim." Mr Assange will initially face UK legal proceedings but could be extradited to the US over the Wikileaks revelations, he added.
