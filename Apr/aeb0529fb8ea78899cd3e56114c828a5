FINALLY Sudanâ€™s President Omar al-Bashir has been replaced by the army that has said it will reign for two years while waiting for a transitional government. Speaking on state TV, Awad Ibn Ouf said the army had decided to oversee the two-year transitional period followed by elections, further declaring a three-month state of emergency in the country. After nearly 30 years in power, Sudan president Omar al-Bashir ruled the country facing sanctions from the US and arrest from the International Criminal Court in the Hague. Protests against Mr Bashir, who has governed Sudan since 1989, have been under way for several months.
