SIX tonnes of biscuits were destroyed in Mwanza City on Tuesday after they were found to be expired in a joint operation targeting expired products in the local markets. The Mwanza City Council Director, Kiomoni Kibamba said over 50,000 boxes of expired biscuits were seized from shops in the operation carried out by a task force formed by officials from the city council, the Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS), the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) and the Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority (TFDA). He cautioned city residents to be careful during shoppings as some dishonest traders were using their ignorance to penetrate expired products in the local markets. “In a joint task which was initiated in January this year, we have discovered a number of dishonest traders with inferior products in the local market some found evading taxes, some engaged with smuggling and many other illegal practices,” said the City Director. Commenting on the exercise, the TBS Acting Head for the Lake Zone, Evarist Mrema said the consignment of expired biscuits was feared to be smuggled in from the neighbouring country. He said following strict market search carried out in January this year the boxes containing over 50,000 pieces of biscuits worth around 45m/-were comprehended thanks to tip offs from good Samaritans. “We are going to maintain such operations in collaboration with other state organs and we ask for members of the public to give us timely,” he said. Over 200m/- being fines and other penalties were collected from the exercise, according to Mr Kibamba.
