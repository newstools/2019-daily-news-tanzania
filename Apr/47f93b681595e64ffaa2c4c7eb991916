LOW participation of foreign investors affected activities at the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE), ending the week on the bearish mood. Zan Securities Limited weekly wrap-ups said the equities market closed the week on a low note due to a few foreign investorsâ€™ activities attributed to the decision of the US Federal reserve to leave rates untouched this year.
