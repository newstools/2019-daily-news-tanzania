In May, 1961 Mwalimu Nyerere became Prime Minister and on December 9, 1961 Tanganyika gained its independence. On January 22, 1962, Nyerere resigned from the Premiership to concentrate on drawing up a Republican Constitution and prepare Tanu for government rather than liberation. On December 9, 1962 Nyerere was elected President of the new Republic of Tanganyika and led the country until 1985 when he stepped down from the presidency in favour of Ali Hassan Mwinyi. Mwalimu was a leading figure behind the modern Pan- African movement, a leading figure in African politics in the 1970s and was one of the founders of OAU (now the African Union). He was born on April 1922 at Butiama Village in Mara Region and died on October 14, 1999, while receiving medical treatment in London.
