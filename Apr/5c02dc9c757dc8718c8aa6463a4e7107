IN continued efforts to control illegal and unregulated tree felling and deforestation in Zanzibar, the Department of Forestry and Non-Renewable Natural Resources (DFNR), has confiscated and destroyed more than six hundred chainsaws. The Director of DFNR, Mr Soud Mohamed, said the operation to confiscate chainsaws was sustainable because they are used for illegal logging and timber trade in the small country with insufficient forests. “Today we will burn 160 chainsaws, which make a total of 600 chainsaws destroyed over the last two years. We are issuing a stern warning that we have zero tolerance on unlicensed chainsaws, and suspects will definitely be taken to court,” said the director. The Minister for Agriculture, Natural Resources, Livestock, and Fisheries, Mr Mmanga Mjengo Mjawir, appealed to people in rural areas to participate in the war by exposing people who cut down trees without permission. He said data from the research institution indicate that Zanzibar loses about one 1,000 hectares of trees annually because of unauthorized tree felling. “We should join forces to protect tree and forests. Coconut trees and fruits trees are also cut down recklessly. In rural areas illegal logging is most rampant,” the minister lamented. Mr Mjawir directed officers in the Department of Forestry and Non Renewable Natural Resources to act tough because its objective was to protect, conserve and develop forest resources for the social, economic and environmental benefit of present and future generations in Zanzibar.
