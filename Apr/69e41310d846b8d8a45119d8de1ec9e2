TANZANIA Coffee Research Institute (TaCRI) plans to produce and distribute to farmers 23.6 million coffee seedlings of new variety in the next three years. These varieties of both Arabica and Robusta coffee seedlings are resistant to the coffee deadly diseases namely Coffee Berry Disease (CBD) and Coffee Leaf Rust (CLR) for Arabica coffee and Coffee Wilt Disease (CWD) for Robusta coffee. These seedlings reduce production cost as less fungicide and herbicide is required, gives higher yields per unit area, produces coffee of bigger bean sizes with good flavor thus liked by many people across the globe fetching good prices in the world market. Tanzania Coffee Research Institute (TaCRI) Chief Executive Director Dr Deusdedit Kilambo said 6.2 million coffee seedlings will be produced in 2018/19, some 8.3 million in 2019/20 and 9.1 million in 2020/21 thus making a total of 23.6 million. “Not only TaCRI but local government authorities (LGA’s) in coffee producing districts across the country will also produce such seedlings through the cooperation with my institute,” Dr Kilambo said. He said the best practice was the establishment of mother tree gardens later to produce such seedlings through clonal vegetative methods. The TaCRI chief said when addressing the 10th National Coffee Stakeholders Meeting held at LAPF Building in Dodoma over the weekend. The TaCRI Chief took time to pay tributes to various districts across the country for their good efforts of supporting and financing the establishments of coffee nurseries which produces respective coffee seedlings. He named such districts to be Nyasa-Ruvuma, Mwese-Tanganyika, Mpanda-Katavi, Kalambo- Rukwa, Kimole-Morogoro, Lushoto-Tanga, Kyerwa- Kagera and Mwanga, Same and Moshi all in Kilimanjaro regions.
