THE Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) in Mara Region has arrested eight prominent businesspeople for tax evasion, including not having Electronic Fiscal Devices (EFDs). The exact value of the taxes in question as well as the identity of the traders was not immediately disclosed pending completion of the ongoing interrogations that will possibly lead to court action. Mara regional TRA manager, Wallace Mnkande told reporters in Musoma on Wednesday that the traders were apprehended in and around the municipality in an operation, the first of its kind to ensure that receipts are issued for all transactions. He also stressed that customers should demand receipts for every purchases, cautioning that not doing so was also illegal and leads to unnecessary loss of trading records during regular inspection by the tax watchdog officers. The manager said there were legal provisions that allowed TRA to impose various penalties on traders during regular operations, including payment of fines, noting that the arrested traders were truly in trouble as they didn’t use EFDs contrary to the law. “Our officials in the field have been conducting surveillance on traders since late last year, including setting up traps,” he revealed. He called on businesspeople who own big companies to get appropriate information on taxation issues so as to avoid inconveniences, especially during application of tax enforcement operations.
