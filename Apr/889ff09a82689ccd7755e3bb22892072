AT long last, coffee farmers in Mara Region have received more than 142m/-, being payment of their produce after selling the cash crop to an overseas market directly through their cooperative union. Wakulima Mara Cooperative Union (WAMACU) Secretary Mr Lucas Masa confirmed the latest development in a brief interview with the ‘Daily News’ recently. “Farmers had expected to earn 850/- per kilo but the good news is that they have earned Sh 925 per kilo after we sold the crop in an overseas market directly,” Mr Masa said. He said more than 142m/- was this week disbursed to 18 primary cooperative societies in different villages. “Farmers are turning up to get their payments and they are excited by the earnings that exceeded their expectations. I am receiving calls of appreciation from coffee farmers,” the WAMACU secretary said. Mr Masa thanked National Microfinance Bank (NMB) for financing the processing, packaging and transportation of the cash crop through WAMACU. The deal involved 70 tonnes of Arabica coffee, according to Mr Masa. Mr Masa also thanked government leaders at regional level for helping to encourage coffee farmers to be patient as they were waiting for the payments. The chairperson of the farmers’ groups’ network in Mara Region, Mr Abd Gasaya, said the increase of price given to the coffee farmers at this time was a vivid example on how, if they are well managed, cooperatives could help to uplift the living standards of famers. Tarime is the leading producer of Arabica coffee in Mara Region. The district produces an average of 2000 tonnes of coffee which is exported to overseas markets every year, according to the head of the Agriculture Department of Tarime District Council, Mr Sylvanus Gwiboha. Tanzania is one of Africa’s leading coffee producers.
