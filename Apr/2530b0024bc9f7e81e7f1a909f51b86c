MAN has been killed with five others badly injured in an ongoing skirmish in Monduli District as a result of community land squabbles. The area acting Regional Police Commander (RPC), James Manyama confirmed the incident and named the dead as Simell Oltialulu, a resident of Lendikinya village. He said Oltialulu was allegedly killed when irate residents from some villages ascended on them with all sorts of traditional weapons citing them as machetes, spears and clubs. The RPC naming the villages as Emairete, Lendikinya and Arkalia, pointed out that all are fighting for ownership of Lendikinya Forest reserve area as ancestrally belonging to each community, where they also camped to fight. “Fellow elders as I went to try to bring peace with other villagers, I was surprised when irate men from Emairate village attacked us,” Oltialulu was reported to have said before being attacked.
