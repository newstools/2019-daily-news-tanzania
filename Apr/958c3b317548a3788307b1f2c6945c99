PARENTS have been urged to provide clear guidance to their children on issues related to money, savings and investment as a better way to manage finance in the future. “The earlier children learn about money, savings and investment, the better they manage their personal finances throughout their lives,” A Brac Tanzania Finance Regional manager, Mr Mohamed Madati said here over the weekend. The Brac’s official, whose organisation hosted students from St Constantine’s International School at a Sakina savings and cooperative society, said parents had a responsibility of molding their children to become good savers, even if they hailed from well-to-do families. According to Mr Madati, such skills help children and youth to understand the difference between earning, saving and spending, making them better money managers, who are able to budget and have healthier money habits. He said that restricting children would limit their chances of becoming innovators and making the most of business opportunities. “We are not doing our children any good when we restrict them in utilizing their potential to become who they wish to be in life,” observed the BRAC official during the climax of the Global Money Week. Mr Madati likewise recommended parents to inculcate the right investing habits in children; a practice he said will help shape their future. Sabrina Mushi, a Form Six student from the International School commended the organization for its initiative of serving the needs of women, young people, and smallholder farmers through group based microloans and enterprise loans.
