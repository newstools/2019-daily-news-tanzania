THE Singita and Grumeti Fund has organised an all-woman, 5-day, 30 and 90 kilometres races across the vast Serengeti wilderness to raise funds for girl and women empowerment programmes in Tanzania. The second annual race, dubbed Safaris With A Purpose, will be held between October 25 and 30 this year with a sole commitment of empowering girls and women to take on leadership roles in conservation. The purpose-driven opportunity will raise funds towards programmes for the empowerment of girls and women, specifically focused on providing opportunities for women to become leaders in conservation. It will cover a flexible, multi-stage distance of 21km per day over 3 days, according to information obtained from Singita newsletter. “We aim to raise $250,000 for girl and women empowerment programmes,” read part of the statement in the newsletter. The amount will be used to run programmes to educate future female leaders in conservation and positively reach over 1,500 women and girls. “The multi-stage event invites runners of all levels to cross the vast plains in Singita’s private concession in the western corridor of the Serengeti, where they’ll encounter an abundance of wildlife and breathtaking scenery at every turn. They will be accompanied by expertly trained, experienced anti-poaching scouts from the Grumeti Fund, who’ll keep an eye out for curious animals, while a support team in a shadow vehicle will be on hand to take care of their safety and comfort.” During the five-night itinerary, the participants will also visit the Grumeti Fund’s Environmental Education Centre, which hosts week-long courses for local students on conservation and minimising impact on the Earth, as well as an opportunity to meet the Fund’s antipoaching team to find out how they preserve and protect the region’s critical ecosystem. The Serengeti Girls Run is expected to offer participants various opportunities to engage with the women who benefit from these programmes
