DEFENDING champions JKT and JKT Stars are among the teams that have so far confirmed participation in this year’s Union Basketball Championship. JKT who are the men’s discipline champs and JKT Stars, the women category’s title holders will defend their titles in the four-day competition to be held in Zanzibar from April 23 to 26 this year. Tanzania Basketball Federation’s official Manase Zablon told the ‘Daily News’ in Dar es Salaam yesterday that preparation has already started and is on a top gear at the moment. He said they have already received confirmation from 13 teams from Tanzania Mainland and Isles, including the two men and women’s titles defenders. “We are happy that things are getting into a right direction, we have 13 teams so far. There are seven men’s teams while six others are women’s,” he said. Zablon named other teams seeking the tournament’s diadem in men’s discipline as ABC, Oilers, African Magic, Police Zanzibar, Stone Town and Nyuki. Women’s teams are Jeshi Stars, KVZ, JKU, African Magic Ladies and New West. Zablon, however, said that invitation for the annual competition is extended to only local teams and hope others will join soon so as to make the event a success. Dar es Salaam teams are likely to renew NBL League rivalry during the coming Muungano Cup as there are three leading teams in the bandwagon. They include the current leaders ABC, JKT and Oilers who are placed second and third but, all have attained 10 points from five matches. He said their skills will be again tested in Zanzibar by the Zanzibar-based teams.
