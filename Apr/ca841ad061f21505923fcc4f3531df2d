GEITA Gold Mine (GGM) has emerged as the overall winner of both Occupation Safety and Health (OSH) and OSHA Exhibition for 2019 awards. The Tanzania Occupational Safety and Health Authority (OSHA) said GGM beat 40 other companies that participated in the exhibition to emerge the overall winner. The Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office (Labour, Employment, Youth and the Disabled) Jenista Mhagama said all companies should have participated in the exhibition event to realise the occupational safety at their workplaces as best as they could. “With the government’s direction towards an industrialised economy, issues of safety and health at workplace are unavoidable. “The government will ensure that investors are adhering to occupational safety and health regulations at work along with their other activities,” the minister, who was chief guest, said over the weekend. This year’s theme was titled “Safety and Health and the future of work towards the Industrial Economy”. Ms Mhagama said the government was glad that this year’s commemorations are taking place when all laws and regulations related to safety and health especially unnecessary fees have already been reviewed to simplify the compliance process. Receiving the awards on behalf of the GGM Management, Senior Manager for Health, Safety, Environment and Training Dr Kiva Mvungi said the recognition has demonstrated that the miner had good systems and programmes to embrace safety as a number one value to both employees and contractors. “We are very delighted to receive these awards because it is a good feedback that GGM is fully complying with safety and health standards for its employees and contractors. GGM scooped the awards beating its competitors Shanta Mine, Acacia, Williamson Diamonds and others after showing high levels and standards of safety and health issues to its workers.
