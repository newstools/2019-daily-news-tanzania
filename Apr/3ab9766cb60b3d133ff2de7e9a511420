WOMEN choosing to shift from one family planning method to another should be allowed to do so without any restriction. That was said here yesterday by Deputy Minister for Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children Dr FaustineNdugulile, further directing medics in all health facilities in the country to respect their will. He made the revelation in an exclusive interview with ‘Daily News’, stating that according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), all family planning methods are safe, hence, whoever wants to make a change should not be prohibited. Currently, he said that the ministry’s record indicates that about 38 per cent of all women capable of giving birth are using various methods of family planning. The interview came as a result of complaints from some women here that the health service providers were restricting them on certain methods against their wishes, and hence they thought of going for other choices. “Mostly used modern methods of family planning by women include Depoprovera injections, implants and oral contraceptives, and up to date we don’t have any record or cases of death or even major side effects caused by them, rather than minor side effects which may occur to any one even those who are taking paracetamol tablets,” pointed out Dr Ndugulile.
