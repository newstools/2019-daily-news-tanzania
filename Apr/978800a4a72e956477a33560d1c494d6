THE government has instructed regional and district commissioners as well as regional administrative secretaries to consider gender balance when posting teachers to schools. This government directive comes after concerns emerged in the National Assembly yesterday that some schools have either male or female teachers only. Deputy Minister of State in the President’s Office (Regional Administration and Local Government), Mr Mwita Waitara, said the issue was within the capacity of the regional and local authorities. “You will find a mixed school has only one female or male teacher, this isn’t proper,” Mr Waitara told the Parliament. He issued the directive following information from CHADEMA lawmaker, Suzan Kiwanga (Mlimba), who informed the House that some schools have only male or female teachers. Ms Kiwanga wanted to hear from the government’s response over the matter. Earlier when reacting to a basic question from Special Seats MP Felister Bura (CCM), the Deputy Minister explained the government effort to increase the number of science teachers in secondary schools in Dodoma region. Ms Bura told Parliament that the region was facing a shortage of 527 science teachers, and wanted to know plans in place to address the shortage. Mr Waitara said the capital city of Dodoma has a total of 221 secondary schools with 72,254 students. The schools needed 1,641 science and mathematics teachers, but the current number of those teachers is 916, thus making a deficit of 527 teachers. He said that the government’s plan is to keep recruiting more teachers in phases to address the shortage. “The President’s Office (Regional and Local Governments) has for now acquired an approval to recruit 4,549 teachers, out of this, 1,374 will be science and mathematics teachers,” he said. He added that the procedure to recruit the teachers is at final stages and that they will be posted to councils facing acute shortage of teachers, including councils in Dodoma region.
