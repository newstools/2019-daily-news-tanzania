BAKHRESA Food Products has started to produce Vimto drinks locally thanks to a partnership with United Kingdom’s Nichols plc. The partnership has saved the country foreign exchange that was used for importation and will also bring back jobs to locals. The Bakhresa Food Products, CEO, Mr Salim Aziz, said under the partnership, Vimto, an international drinks brand, will be produced and distributed in the country by Bakhresa and exported to some SADC countries namely Zambia, DRC, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. “We are very happy to bring Vimto to Tanzania and announce our new partnership with Nichols. “We look forward to a long and prosperous partnership with Vimto and Nichols,” Mr Aziz told journalists in Dar es Salaam yesterday. The drinks will be produced by Bakhresa under a licence from Nichols and the giant East African soft drink producers will not export to Uganda, Kenya and Sudan since have their own factories. The Groups has a turnover exceeds 800 million US dollars and it is the proud employer of more than 8,000 people. Vimto, a unique mixedfruit drink, will be available in 300ml plastic bottles and later in 250ml cans. Nichols Africa Regional Director, Robert Hammersley, said Bakhresa is a manufacturing giant in East Africa and they are delighted to be commencing the partnership with them. “We are thrilled to be launching Vimto in Tanzania and are looking forward to working with Bakhresa to bring Vimto to Tanzanian consumers and local businesses,” Mr Hammersley said. He said the country is a key strategic market for Nichols and one where Vimto has a history but through importation. “We hope that Vimto will bring many moments of joy to Tanzanians for years to come,” Mr Hammersley said. Vimto, originating from Manchester, UK, made to the same secret recipe since 1908 and is available in 85 countries globally.
