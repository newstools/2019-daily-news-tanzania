MOROGORO Municipal Council (MMC) is facing difficulty for formalizing motorcycle taxiing system (bodaboda) since riders are leaving it within two years. The MMC records showed that the council registered 1,890 groups in 2014 but only 12 groups with 341 members remained at the end of last week, the rest are untraceable. MMC Social Welfare Officer, Ms Catherine Mrosso said most bodaboda riders are not owners thus leaving the business hence the group in short period to backpedal formalisation process. “This leads to most of them to leave the business and automatically disqualified themselves as a group member,” Ms Mrosso said at Dar es Salaam during a breakfast meeting organised by Policy Forum. She said riders are operating by submitting a daily amount of between 7,000/- and 10,000/- once failed owners are ending their contract with a minute notice. Another problem, she said some riders enter into a two years contract with an owner and submit a flat amount for the period and the motorcycle change ownership. Some 40 per cent of the riders we registered were operating in that manner but should the rider failed to honour his or her part the machine is seized handed back to original owner. Another challenge the MMC failed to formalize the bodaboda taxis was road accidents. According to Ms Mrosso, most accidents are aggravated by lack of operating skills and safety regulation which leads to death and disabled. Also criminality and robbery are factor behind the failure to formalize the sector in the region. The Council survey showed that more than 85 per cent of the riders in the municipal are between 18 – 30 years old and that some of them are only part time operators. “Some employed persons rides bodaboda after working hours to maximize their income therefore they are not in groups,” she said.
