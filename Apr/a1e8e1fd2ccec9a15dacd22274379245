SERENGETI Boys Head Coach, Oscar Mirambo (pictured) has praised his players for the good fighting spirit showed at the just ended Invitational tournament in Kigali, Rwanda. On Thursday, Serengeti Boys lifted the trophy after battling to a 3-3 draw against hosts Rwanda Junior Wasps at the Nyamirambo Stadium in Kigali, to collect four points, ahead of Cameroon, who settled second with three points, while Rwanda settled last with a point. In their first outing, Serengeti Boys defeated Cameroon 2-1 before being held Junior Wasps in the last game on Thursday evening. Rwanda lost 3-1 in their opening match to Cameroon. “Although, we still have some gaps to work on, I am generally happy with the level of commitment shown by the players. They have showed that they can fight,” added Mirambo. Coach Mirambo said that the technical bench needs to work out on the weaknesses that emerged during the tournament and that they have to tighten things in the defence and goalkeeping departments respectively. Both Tanzania and Cameroon used the Invitational tournament to prepare for the Under-17 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) finals to be staged in Dar es Salaam from April 14th to 28th this year. Hosts Serengeti Boys are pooled in group A of the tournament alongside Uganda, Angola and Nigeria. The Boys will kick off their campaign against giants Nigeria on April 14th in the opening day of the tournament, before Uganda battle Angola in the second game all to be hosted at the National Stadium.
