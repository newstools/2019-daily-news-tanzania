TANZANIA Agricultural Research Institute (TARI) will from this year organise Farmers’ Field Day to showcase good agricultural practices to the farmers to improve their participations and activities in the country. Launching the programme here yesterday, Head of the TARI’s Makutupora Centre, Dr Cornel Masawe, said TARI has introduced Farmers’ Field Day to provide farmers with key platform to acquire more knowledge on modern agriculture. “The main goal of the new programme is to enable farmers visit demonstration farms in Makutupora Centre,” said the Head of TARI. However, Dr Masawe challenged the farmers to form associations to enable agricultural experts visit them, noting that the professionals would advise them on recommended good agricultural practices. The Center’s Research Coordinator, Dr Elias Letayo, revealed that TARI’s Makutopora Centre was currently conducting various research projects on different crops seeking to solve problems facing farmers. “For instance, most farmers in Dodoma are failing to get bumper harvests due to Climate challenges. But the Makutupora Centre has so far managed to develop drought resistant seeds for a number of crops, which is an opportunity for farmers,” he said. Delivering vote of thanks, Mr Keneth Makole, one of the farmers, said Farmers’ Field Day would provide farmers with ideal platform to share experiences on agriculture, further pointing out that the programme would help them to increase yields and improve in other related sectors. “The Farmers’ Field Day will enable us to get more knowledge on modern agriculture, and hence improve in our agricultural production,” said Kenneth Makole, a farmer from Gawaye village.
