THE National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has said the Annual Headline Inflation Rate for the month of March has slightly increased to 3.1 per cent from 3.0 per cent recorded in February due to price increase of non-food products. NBS’s Director of Population, Census and Social Statistics, Mr Ephraim Kwesigabo, noted here yesterday that the increase of the headline inflation explains that the speed of price change for commodities for the year ended March, 2019 has gone up. “It explains that the speed of price change for commodities for the year ended March, 2019 has increased compared to the speed of the price change recorded for the year ended February, 2019,” said the NBS’s senior official during a monthly press conference on the inflation rate. As for other East African nations, Mr Kwesigabo pointed out that while the annual inflation rate for the month of March remained 3.0 per cent in Uganda, the rate for the same month in Kenya had increased to 4.34 per cent from 4.14 per cent recorded in February. He said Food and Non Alcoholic Beverages Inflation Rate for the month of March had decreased to 0.1 per cent from 0.5 per cent in February, saying Annual Inflation Rate for food consumed at home and away from home for the month of March had decreased to 2.0 per cent from 2.3 per cent recorded in February. Moreover, Mr Kwesigabo, said the 12 month index change for non-food products in March had increased to 5.7 per cent from 5.1 per cent recorded in February, adding that Annual Inflation Rate which excludes food and energy for the month of March has increased to 3.7 per cent from 3.1 per cent recorded in February, 2019.
