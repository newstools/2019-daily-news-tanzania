THE government is going on with its plans of constructing prison facilities in districts, where there is none, the Deputy Minister for Home Affairs, Hamand Masauni told the National Assembly yesterday. Responding to a question by Mr Victor Mwambalaswa (Lupa-CCM), the deputy minister said currently there were 51 districts in the country with no prison, including Chunya District. However, he said, the government’s goal was to ensure each district had a prison facility for rehabilitation purposes, as availability of the facilities in each district would reduce the cost of transporting prisoners from one district to the next and speed up the determination of cases. The deputy minister also pointed out that such a move would decongest remand prisoners in the prisons. In the question, the MP wanted to know when the government would construct a prison in Chunya District. Mr Masauni pointed out that although the government was continuing with the programme of constructing prison facilities in each district, the speed was slow due to inadequate financial resources. “Therefore, the government intends to continue with the construction of the prisons in districts which have no such facility, including Chunya District if funds will be available,” he said. In a supplementary question, Mr John Mnyika (Kibamba-Chadema), wanted to know whether the government would mount a special operation to decongest the prisons, claiming some inmates in such prisons faced cases framed against them. The deputy minster responded that congestion in prisons was being contributed by a number of factors, including crime. But he was quick to point out that there were several committees charged with dealing with the matter. He said there was a committee charged with the speedy determination of cases, the parole board, social services and the alternative sentence committee and the pardon exercised by the Head of State.
