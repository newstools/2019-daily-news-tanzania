HIGHER Education Students' Loans Board (HESLB) has a loan balance of 1.46tri/- from untraceable defaulters, a 2017/18 Controller and Auditor General report reveals. The report said the untraceable significant loan balance may limits the Board’s financial ability to provide more loans to new and continuing students. The amount is significant considering guidance provided by Sect. 4(h)-(g) of the Board’s Act which requires the Board to establish networking and cooperation links with institutions and organisations so as to identify loan beneficiaries and facilitate recovery of granted loans. "I recommend that the Board engage other institutions and any other available sources of information to strengthen its database to be able to identify the yet untraced beneficiaries," the CAG, Prof Mussa Assad said in the report. However, HESLB Executive Director, Razaq Badru said in January that the board had managed to collect 94.01bn/- from loan beneficiaries from January to December last year, surpassing the target of collecting 71.4bn/- in a six months period.
