OVER 1,500 sportsmen and women are heading to Zanzibar for the Easter Sports Festival due to officially start on April 19 this year. That was unveiled here yesterday by the festival coordinator Ali Abdallah Hassan who also serves as an official of Zanzibar Football Association (ZFA) in a meeting with the media. He said there are already 1,350 athletes in Zanzibar and hoped the number likely to increase drastically when the festival begins. “We hope all athletes will be here by Thursday to take part in various sports and cultural events. Sportsmen and women involved come from various clubs, government and private institutions,” he explained. He said the sports festival will last for four days until April 24 this year. He said the festival has, for many years, been uniting people of the Tanzania Mainland and the Isles and was most often rotational. Explaining further, he said the festival turned a national wide event and it continues to hold that status to-date. He said the festival did a commendable job in cementing the Union of Tanganyika and Zanzibar that today marks its 55th anniversary. The Easter sports festival which is held every year during the Easter holidays between people from the Mainland and the Isles is a special sports event. In the early days of its existence, this festival used to involve sports clubs, dance and taarab groups from Zanzibar, Dar es Salaam, Tanga and Mombasa. Later sports clubs, social groups, public and private institutions from Pemba, Morogoro, Arusha and from other parts of the Mainland joined the bandwagon. No doubt, the sports bonanza has gone a long way in bringing together people of different interests and age groups from different parts of the United Republic and in some of the neighbouring countries. Some clubs in Zanzibar also had similar programmes with some sports clubs in Mombasa, Kenya.
