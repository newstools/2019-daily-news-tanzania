IT was a bright day for Pravbir Singh and Jasleen Kaur at Arusha Gymkhana Club after the duo beat tough rivals to Vaisakhi golf title with brilliant score. The duo carded 64 stableford points to win the title beating stiff challenges from Burhanuddin and Umeimah Akil on countback. Akil and Burhahanuddin also returned 64 points. The third overall prize went to Bob Shuma and Linda Francis who returned 65 points while the fourth overall position was taken by RS Cheema and Mandeep Singh who posted 69 points. Fifth overall title was grabbed by Gav Chadha and Manraj Chadha with 69 points. After winning the top silverwarer, Singh and Kaur thanked the organisers and golfers who took part in the tournament saying without them they couldn’t win the title. “The tournament was tough and highly competitive and we won due to the presence of good sponsors and the organisers of the tournament. We are really happy to beat the rest of the title pursuers,” they said. Also Bob Shuma said that the tournament was good as it managed to bring together youth, men and women. “I played together with a woman called Linda Francis and she is such a good player,” he said. He also continued saying that some people say golf is expensive, yes it is true but doing golf is better than staying idle and some diseases are caused by not doing exercise and their expenses you incur at hospital are bigger than a cost of playing golf. The problem is that youth are not encouraged and developed in this golf game and even in our golf club (Arusha Gymkhana) we have very good young golfers who are better than us, but they end up moving the golf trolleys for other golfers.
