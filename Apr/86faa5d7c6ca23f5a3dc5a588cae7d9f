THE government has resolved to conduct in-depth research to identify the actual extent of same sex problem in the country. This was said by Deputy Minister for Health, Social Developments, Gender, Elderly and Children, Dr Faustine Ndungulile, when responding to Ms Najma Giga (Special Seats-CCM)â€™s question on Wednesday. In her question, the MP noted that incidences of rape and defilement to children and same sex were increasing. She wanted to know whether the government saw a need for conducting research to identify the effects caused on society. The legislator further wanted to know when the government would start preparing a penal law for women abusing boys and teaching girls to practise lesbianism. In his response, the deputy minister said the Penal Code (Cap 16), prohibited acts that were contrary to social ethics, including homosexuality. He pointed out, however, that currently, the government had no statistics on the extent of homosexuality in the country. "Therefore, the government sees a need for conducting in-depth research on issues of same sex to identify the crux of the problem," Dr Ndungulile told the House. He said after research the government would look into a possibility of making amendments and improving the laws available to deal with the issue accordingly. In line with that, the deputy minister said the government recognised that the law alone would not solve the problem. Therefore, he said the government would continue laying emphasis on the importance of keeping Tanzanian values. On a whether his ministry would sit together with the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology to see ways of putting in place a plan of action on the issue, the deputy minister said that they would work on the advice and its practicability.
