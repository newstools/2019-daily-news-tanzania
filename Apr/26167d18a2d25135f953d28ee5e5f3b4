The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has commended Tanzanian government for banning the use of single use plastic bags in the country. According to press statement issued by WWF’s Director General Dr Marco Lambertin, the organization reaffirms its commitment to support Tanzania's efforts to tackle the plastics pollution crisis with science based insights on plastic pollution. “We witness over eight million tonnes of plastics entering the oceans annually and an additional 104 million tonnes of plastics is expected to pollute our ecosystems by 2030 unless immediate action is taken, it is impacting nature, livelihoods, human health and wildlife in ways that science is only now starting to understand,” he said. For his part the WWF Tanzania Country Director Dr Amani Ngusaru said plastic is a number one polluter of environment and a silent killer of natural environment and living resources than most people understand. It takes more than a hundred years for a single plastic bag to decay, and that creates a huge problem. Tanzania joins about 13 countries in Africa including Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda that have either banned or introduced a levy on plastic bags to control and eventually stop its use.
