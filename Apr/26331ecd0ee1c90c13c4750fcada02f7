However, their health status should be verified by a panel of medical doctors under the supervision of regional or district medical officers. Inmates aged 70 and above and those with physical and mental disabilities have also benefitted from thepresidential pardon after medical doctors verify their health status before their release. The President also pardoned the inmates, who started serving their sentences while pregnant, as well as breastfeeding mothers.

Other inmates not covered in the presidential pardon are those, whose conviction is related to illegal drugs, corruption, robbery with violence, armed robbery and attempted armed robbery. The statement further says that, the President did not pardon inmates jailed for possessing fire arms, ammunitions and explosives. Inmates convicted of rape, sodomy, violence against children, impregnating schoolgirls and those under the Prisons Extra Mural Penal Employment Regulation are similarly not involved in the amnesty. Others are the prisoners convicted of economic sabotage, human trafficking, poaching, abuse of office, as well as those convicted of habitual offences.
