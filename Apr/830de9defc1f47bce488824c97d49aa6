KMKM claimed the Isles League title following their 2-0 victory over KVZ at Amaan Stadium on Wednesday. KMKM have been assured the championship title after collecting 77 points with a game in hand. The match with KVZ, who led the league for a long time, was a decisive encounter as both teams were well positioned for the title prior to that encounter. Even if KMKM lose their last game and KVZ win, still they will remain champs as superior goal average favours them. The game started with a cracking pace and sporadic raids, but no goal was scored until the end of the first half. On resumption, KMKM looked more organised than KVZ and began constantly raiding their opponents’ goal. Their efforts paid off ten minutes after the restart when Abdulrahman Othman Chinga netted the opener for KMKM in the 55th minute. KVZ responded strongly after conceding the goal, but all their efforts couldn’t yield fruits. KVZ struggle ended some minutes later when KMKM added the second goal through Mudriki Muhibu’s spotkick. KMKM won a spotkick after KVZ defender Iddy Mgeni handled the ball in an attempt to clear the danger inside the box, and Muhibu slammed home the expertly taken shot. As the Zanzibar Premier League champion, KMKM will represent the Isles in the CAF Champions League tournament next season while the winner of the Isles FA Cup tournament will play in CAF Confederation Cup championship. Zanzibar Premier League which involved 19 teams in a race for the diadem is expected to climax this Sunday.
