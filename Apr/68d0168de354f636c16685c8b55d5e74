THE Tanzania Building Agency (TBA) has revived the Magomeni quarters construction project in Dar es Salaam that had stalled for eight months due to the increase of building materials costs. TBA’s Acting Chief Executive Officer, Eng Jasper Lugemalira, said the building materials included cement, and the cost of hiring some construction equipments was also prohibitive. He explained that the agency had lately acquired its own machines, expressing optimism that the project would be completed in December this year. He pointed out, though, that shortage of workers posed another challenge. Eng Lugemalira made the revelations last Saturday, during a tour of the site by the Deputy Minister for Works, Transport and Communication, Mr Elias Kwandikwa. Mr Kwandikwa said the government, through the Ministry of Works planned to employ more workers in order to increase the capacity of the implementation of various projects undertaken by the agency. He said the agency’s demand was 1,700 employees. “As a ministry we will discuss how to solve some challenges facing TBA in implementing its various projects,” he said. He further noted that the agency should work day and night to make sure that the Magomeni Quarters construction project was completed in December this year as they promised. “You have materials, just set a good work plan that would help you to complete the project on time but you have to consider the issue of quality and avoid unnecessary costs,” said Mr Kwandikwa. The project that involves construction of 644 houses at 20bn/- aims to accommodate about 640 families after completion, was launched by President John Magufuli in April 2016.
