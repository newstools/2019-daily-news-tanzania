Signing the project contract, the Trade and Industries PS said that the project would be a milestone in the creating jobs to the nationals.

Senior Officers from the Alemdar, Ms Fatma Atala and Mr Oktay Alemdar confirmed that when they met Zanzibar’s second Vice-President Ambassador Seif Ali Iddi in his office.
