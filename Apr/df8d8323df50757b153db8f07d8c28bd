THE Ministry of Works, Transport and Communications, through the Tanzania National Roads Agency (Tanroads), has reviewed all bumps constructed on highways in the country and realised 323 of them are unfriendly to vehicles and other travelling devices. This was said before the National Assembly by Deputy Minister Elias Kwandikwa in the question and answer session. However, he said, rectification of such bumps was going on as up to date 281 bumps had been repaired. He said some of the roads, whose bumps in brackets had been rectified included Kibaha-Mlandizi (6), Morogoro-Iringa (12), Mara-Simiyu (12), Igawa-Songwe (3), Uyole-Kasumulu (2), Mwanza-Simiyu (9), Shelui-Nzega (5), Singida-Manyara (23), Mutukula-Bukoba-Kigoma (7) and other areas (202). The deputy minister assured MPs and members of the public at large that all bumps, which did not deserve to be on roads, would be removed, while those, which were not up to standard would be reconstructed. He also appealed to all drivers in the country to observe road signs, including speed limits. Mr Kwandikwa was responding to a question by Mr Abdallah Mtolea (Temeke-CCM), who said the government needed to construct roads to reduce traffic jams and simplify transport. However, he said, the roads with bumps, which were unfriendly to travelling devices, forcing some of the users to escape them, for example,Â on Msata-Bagamoyo Road. The lawmaker, therefore, wanted to know whether bumps were part of the road signs. Responding, the deputy minister told the House that road signs provided information on the proper use of roads. Therefore, according to him, due to defying road signs, in particular speed limits the government was compelled to put bumps in risky areas to make drivers reduce the speed. He pointed out, however, that having considered some of the bumps were unfriendly to motorists, the government prepared the Road Geometric Design Manual, 2011, which provided for standards for the construction of bumps.
