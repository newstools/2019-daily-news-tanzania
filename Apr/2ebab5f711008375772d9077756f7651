THE police in Coast Region are holding a resident of Kibaha Township identified as Mr Robinson Ernest (33) for allegedly killing a six-month old baby girl on grounds that he did not father her. Coast Regional Police Commander (RPC), Wankyo Nyigesa said yesterday that the suspect allegedly committed the offence on Monday at 4.30pm at Vitendo Street in Misugusugu Ward, Kibaha District. According to the police, before being married to Mr Ernest, the mother of the baby girl had a relationship with another man, who the suspected killer believed was the biological father of the baby. RPC Nyigesa added that after being questioned by the police, the mother told the police that her husband had made two attempts to kill the baby, but she managed to rescue her before he finally accomplished his evil mission. Explaining how the evil plan began, RPC Nyigesa said in the first attempt Mr Ernest had tried to give the baby poisonous tablets, but her mother managed to save her. The police did not mention the name of the baby’s mother. Likewise, in the second attempt, Mr Ernest is alleged to have sharpened his machete with the intention to kill the baby. This time too, he didn’t succeed because the baby’s mother managed to rescue her. Referring to the mother’s statement, the police said, the suspected killer made the third evil attempt by strangling the baby using his own hands and this time he was successful. The baby was taken to Tumbi Hospital for further investigation before she was given to her relatives for burial. The regional police boss warned against all those mistreating children, saying the police won’t tolerate such evil behaviour.
