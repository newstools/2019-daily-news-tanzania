PLANS are underway for Dodoma City Council to develop a road network master plan which will facilitate road connection between the city centre and important areas, including railway stations, bus terminal and airport. The Mayor of Dodoma City Council, Prof Davis Mwamfupe, made the revelation here during a recent Regional Road Board meeting, pointing out that the master plan would facilitate transport for city residents. “The road network master plan should reflect demands of road users, business and day to day activities,” said the Mayor of Dodoma City Council during the meeting which draws its members from the Council and Tanzania National Roads Agency (TANROADS). Prof Mwamfupe said for any fast growing city, there should be a city road network master plan to improve transport services, saying the road network master plan is vital for addressing traffic congestion in future. On his part, the City Director, Mr Godwin Kunambi, noted that the road network master plan would connect the city centre with Msalato International Airport (MIA), whose construction would start soon and Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), stations. He explained further that the road network master plan would facilitate connection with Government City in Ihumwa suburb of Dodoma City, State House in Chamwino and a junction for Singida, Arusha and Iringa highways. “Under the road network master plan, the Government City and Msalato International Airport will be connected with roads towards junctions for Morogoro, Singida, Arusha and Iringa highways,” he said. Mr Kunambi said the City Council was currently improving ring roads to assist in reducing traffic volumes in the city centre, pointing out that the ring roads offer an alternative route around the City. “People travelling between Dodoma and Morogoro using SGR will disembark at Ihumwa Railway Station to take a bus to the upcountry bus terminal,” he said. Mr Kunambi said the city council has this financial year earmarked 77.7bn/-for improvement of road infrastructure projects, saying on July 1, 2018, the City Council entered into a contract with Chico Contractors to undertake the project
