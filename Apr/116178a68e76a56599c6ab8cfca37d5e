TOURISM companies will not be allowed to set up seasonal mobile camps close to Mara River so as to leave the areas free for thousands of tourists visiting the world famous Serengeti National Park (SENAPA) during the wildebeest migration . “We have agreed that from this year, that all seasonal camps that are normally set up near the river should be relocated, “ former SENAPA Chief Park Warden, Mr William Mwakilema told the ‘Daily News’ over the phone yesterday. Mr Mwakilema, the Deputy Commissioner of Conservation and Business at the Tanzania National Parks (TANAPA), said it was important to leave the areas near Mara River free for tourists, to spare them of disturbances. Mara River is the crossing point of the great annual wildebeest migration that attracts large numbers of tourists every year. “We expect to receive many tourists next tourism season and Mara River attracts many during the wildebeest migration,” said Mr Mwakilema who served as SENAPA Chief Park Warden for several years before he was moved to his new position recently. The decision to relocate seasonal tourist camps from the areas adjacent the river will also complement ongoing efforts to protect and conserve the river which forms an integral part of the Serengeti- Mara ecosystem, he said. Mr Mwakilema underscored the importance of promoting sustainable conservation of the river, describing it as a life line of the annual great wildebeest migration. Mara River is a transboundary river which runs through Masai-Mara Game Reserve in Kenya and Serengeti National Park in Tanzania before flowing into Lake Victoria on the Tanzanian side. Besides its contribution on conservation of the Serengeti ecosystem, the river supports the livelihood of more than 1.1 million people in Tanzania and Kenya Its basin covers about 13,750 square kilometres.
