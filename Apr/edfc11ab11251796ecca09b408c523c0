Reports had it that Belgium’s top Premier League side Anderlecht FC are the latest to show interest in promising youthful striker. John is gifted with pace, guile and an eye for goals and he has proved a great asset for the team. According to a source that attended a meeting on Thursday with the player’s guardian, Anderlecht FC are interested in investing to prepare the striker for two years with a training programme to run in Belgium and Tanzania. “They want him to keep travelling to train in Belgium as they prepare him because he is not yet 18 years old to officially be signed as per the FIFA rules,” said the source. The source said the representatives of Anderlecht FC and another second Division team in Sweden have submitted a programme for the player. The Swedish team reportedly wants to take player and his father to settle in Sweden as he undergoes professional training. The other teams that have shown interest in the player in the past weeks include Ajax Amsterdam FC and Manchester City.
