THE Bank of Tanzania (BoT) and government authorities here have warned Tanzanians against increasing abuse of bank notes, saying it is an unlawful act. Regional Commissioner (RC) for Urban-West Region, Mr Ayoub Mohamed Mahmoud directed the police to arrest anyone abusing the bank notes, followed by being prosecuted, as Mr Y ahya Mchujuko, one of the senior staff in the Zanzibar BoT Branch said if convicted, the person risk jail or heavy fine. The warning was issued at the beginning of a sensitization campaign for residents here on the appropriate use of the TZ bank notes following increasing abuse of the notes, including being used for decorations during weddings. “As from today, I prohibit using bank notes in unauthorized waya. I also order the police to search and arrest people who manufacture fake notes because it is among high level crimes affecting the economy,” RC Mahmoud said. Mr Fidelis Mkatte and Ms Vicky Msina, facilitators from BoT at the sensitization workshop held at the central bank’s building here, hinted that with proper awareness, people can stop abusing bank notes and easily detect counterfeit ones. According to the facilitators, the awareness programme aimed at reminding people on the need to respect bank notes and how to identify fake currency notes. The BoT officers and the RC lamented the fact that some Tanzanians do not respect local notes, saying they ought to value the notes because they serve as symbols of national identity. Using the notes as decorations in functions such as weddings, tearing, soiling, writing on them, folding and using them for cleaning, are some of the reported types of abuse on bank notes.
