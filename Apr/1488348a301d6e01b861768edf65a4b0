Astronomers have managed to take the first ever image of a black hole, which is located in a distant galaxy. The black hole, according to Wikipedia, is  a “black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it.” The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) describes that the black hole is 500 million trillion km away and was photographed by a network of eight telescopes across the world. The scientists said during a live stream press conference at held the National Science Foundation (NSF) in Washington, on Wednesday at 1300 GMT, that an image of the black hole at the center of a galaxy known as M87. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Project director Sheperd Doeleman said that, “I am delighted to report today (Wednesday) that we have seen and taken a picture of what we thought was not possible, like seeing the useable.” He said that black holes are among the mysterious mater in the universe, “it is an extraordinary feeling to be part of the team to see such an image for the first time. We now have evidence of the existence of the black hole. “This has verified Albert Einstein’s theory on gravity in an extreme way,” he stated. The EHT, was a worldwide attempt to catch the first-ever photo of a black hole's immediate surroundings, included a team of over 200 people, in about 20 countries, and about 60 institutes finally managed to come with the image today. National Science Foundation (NSF) media advisory described it as "groundbreaking." The project has succeeded in its goal and is treated to some stunning picture of the silhouette of a black hole. Black holes are made up of huge amounts of matter squeezed into a small area, creating a massive gravitational field which draws in everything around it, including light, according to NASA,
