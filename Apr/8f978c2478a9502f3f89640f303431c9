A REPUTABLE Security company has expressed interest to help the Ministry of Minerals to install high-tech security systems in at all mining zones in the country especially in Mirerani. Magal Security Systems, a leading international provider of solutions, services and products for physical security, cyber security, and safety and site management expressed the commitment through its company’s Business Development and Sales Director, Michael Gur Arie, when he met the Minister for Minerals Dotto Biteko in Dodoma. According to Mr Arie his company has a capacity to install security systems at Mirerani, which can help the ministry to monitor every activity that is ongoing at the site. He said: “without wasting time I want to be there physically to monitor the mining operations and start the work.” In response, Mr Biteko thanked him for the concern, saying that his ministry was well determined to ensure that security at Mirerani Tanzanite mining centre was highly guaranteed to ensure that the country’s resources are protected. “The government is highly prioritizing the issue of security at Mirerani area and the ministry had put up a plan to run in two phases in implementing the security issues at the area,’’ he pointed out. According to the minister, the first phase was erecting a wall surrounding the mining site and installation of security cameras, while plans for the second phase were still ongoing. He further said that implementation in the second phase would kick off after the approval of the 2019/2020 budget by the Parliament. During the occasion, the Minister spared time to meet and hold talks with leaders of the Federation of the Miner’s Association of Tanzania (FEMATA), led by their Chairman, John Bina, where they dwelt on issues facing miners in the country.
