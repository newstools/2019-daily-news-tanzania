A NEW study has proposed a Value Added Tax (VAT) reduction on capital commodities under fixed government savings, if the government wants to promote development of the industrial sector and retain its revenue collection targets. Analysis of the tax structure in Tanzania was the focus of the study, which was carried out by the Department of Economics and Statistics of the University of Dodoma (UDOM), in collaboration with Partnership for Economic Policy (PEP). The research team which relied on secondary data, used a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model and a Social Accounting Matrix of the 2015 Tanzanian economy to analytically examine a decrease in the VAT rate on capital commodities .According to a researcher, Dr Joel Mmasa, the team sought to understand the short-term impact it may have on households and the overall economy. “The study also investigated whether a partial VAT reduction would provoke the intended economic benefits of the policy, without reducing government revenues too much,’’ he added. Presenting the research findings at the first National Policy Conference on how VAT reductions on capital commodities can help to achieve the country’s development, the Chief Investigator, Dr Asiya Maskaeva, said the government budget relied more on indirect taxes (partially the VAT) than on direct taxes as a revenue source. “As such, a partial VAT reduction on capital commodities can be expected to have a certain impact on government income,’’ she said. According to her, a VAT rate reduction under fixed government savings may be more beneficial to Tanzania’s economy than one in which government savings are flexible. The study also found out that since the country’s budget relied heavily on indirect taxes and VAT in particular, the government could promote the development of the industrial sector and retain its revenue by reducing rather than exempting the VAT rate on capital commodities.
