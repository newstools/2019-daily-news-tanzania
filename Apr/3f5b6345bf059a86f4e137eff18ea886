TANZANIA Bureau of Standards (TBS) has impounded bales of banned second hand underpants worth more than 10m/- in various markets in Musoma District, Musoma Region. The TBS Inspector Mr Baraka Bajije said over the weekend here that the impromptu inspections conducted in the town council aimed at removing substandard goods in the markets and ensuring that traders adhere to the laws and regulations. “The inspections in this area of Musoma Region has been very successful and will continue in other parts of the Lake Zone in order those goods which meet the required standards remain in the market for the safety of the consumers,” he said. Apart from the consignment of banned used underpants, he said also that various samples of goods were taken to the bureau laboratory to check whether they meet the required quality standards for consumption. He said TBS Act No 2 of 2009 prohibits use of second hand underpants and towels however some unfaithful traders have continued to bring them into the market using unofficial routes. Mr Bajije emphasized that used underpants are not allowed in the market due to health effects to the users causing diseases like fungus, and skin cancer. He urged consumers to shun away from using second hand underpants in order to avoid the said diseases. Ms Joyce Magesa, resident of Musoma said, “We were used to buy used underpants because they are cheap and durable but after getting awareness from TBS on their effects we are not using them anymore.” She admitted that women are the main customers of the second hand underpants than men without knowing health effects to their bodies. TBS officials were currently carrying inspections in various parts of the Lake Zones in order to remove substandard goods in the markets and protect the health of the people. Some of the areas covered are Mwanza, Sengerema, Magu, Bunda and Musoma.
