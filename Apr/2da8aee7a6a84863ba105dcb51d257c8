DEPUTY Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism Costantine Kanyasu has ordered national park and game reserve wardens to seize livestock and arrest people who graze cattle in reserved areas. “Currently, the officers seize livestock but allow the owners to go scot free. When you seize livestock, make sure you arrest those who are found grazing them in the reserved areas,” he said, adding: “We always get reports that owners vanish after their livestock are seized, but we are aware of the dirty game behind this matter,” Mr Kanyasu said. The minister issued the order in the light of information that some officers allow the owners to go to the village to look for money with which to bribe them in order to release their seized livestock. He explained, however, that most of the livestock owners didn’t return for fear of being arrested. He directed the officers to establish camps wherever they found livestock in the reserved areas without their owners, and stay there until they resurfaced. “Since you are trained officers, you certainly know which tactics to apply to get the culprits,” he remarked further. The deputy minister was speaking to Swagaswaga and Mkungunero game reserve wardens and managers during an official tour of Kondoa District, Dodoma Region. He said the corruption accusations would only end when the officers would be able to seize livestock and simultaneously arrest the owners. He pointed out that a total of 200 livestock whose owners were not known were in Mkungunero game reserve. “The story should end today; we want you to seize livestock and arrest the owners; else, you are in trouble,” Kanyasu emphatically stated. One of the officers, Mr Raphael Ochieng, explained that the general trend was for people found grazing livestock in the reserved areas to flee from the officers by climbing trees. He refuted reports that the officers sought bribes from livestock owners, whom he accused of spreading such rumours to tarnish their good image.
