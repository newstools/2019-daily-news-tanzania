DEMAND for risk management professionals is currently high as the government is transforming its operations into digital system—E-government. Institute of Risk Management Tanzania (IRMT) Vice President Buyamba Buyamba said in Dar es Salaam over the weekend that the professionals were highly needed to anticipate risks in the digital system that may be brought by hackers. “We are prone to Information and Communications Technology (ICT) risk,” said Mr Buyamba at the graduation ceremony for 25 students who were conferred with certificates as certified risk management professionals. “I advise the public workers as well as those working with private sector to pursue risk management courses at the institute to help their institutions,” he advised. Mr Buyamba said risk management field remains new in the country and IRMT was marketing itself to make it known more to Tanzanians. The institute has so far trained a number of professionals in risk management like those working with Tanzania Meteorological Agency (TMA), providing guides on how to manage climate change related risks. “We are happy that our graduates are doing a good job at TMA, one good example is the recent alert on imminent cyclone Kenneth..,” he stated. CRDB Bank Director of Risk Management and Compliance, Mr Anderson Mlabwa, insisted that the technology was growing so rapidly among the institutions like banks but the criminals also work to advance their skills. This calls for more professionals in risk management to anticipate risks and manage them. He said the risk management profession started to be recognised in 2011 and banks were highly prone to the risks. In the bank sector, the main risks include the credit risk, strategic risk, market risk, liquidity risk, compliance risk and ICT risk.
