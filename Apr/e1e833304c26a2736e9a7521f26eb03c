IN efforts to end or minimize the problem of bare-footing among students in rural areas, a total of 400 new shoes have been donated to nursery and standard one pupils at Kijini School, North A district in Unguja Island. “I am happy to have the shoes. I am not used to wearing shoes because my mother has not bought them for me. I only wear shoes during Eid (Muslim holiday). I always go to school barefooted,” said seven year-old Haji Mwadini enthusiastically. It was said at the event that many children walk long distances of about five or more kilometres to and from school while barefooted on stony rough roads in all weather conditions, which is an inconvenience to the pupils. One of the parents, Ms Saada Omar, expressed her gratitude for the donation of the shoes and thanked the donor, Best of Zanzibar from Matemwe coastal village who have been running the ‘Pair for every child (PEC)’ campaign since last year. According to the ‘Best of Zanzibar’ Programme Director, Ms Aminata Keita, the PEC campaign managed to raise funds to buy shoes for 700 children in Kijini and Mbuyu-tende schools last year. “We want to see that all children in the schools wear shoes, learn in favourable environment and perform well in examinations,” Keita said as she thanked partners in the campaign from South Africa and Middle East for their support. The pennyroyal investor through its Best of Zanzibar has since 2017 been supporting the Kijini and Mbuyutende students to improve English and Mathematics as important subjects in their education. Pennyroyal is a UK firm planning to invest more than a $1 billion (2trl/=) at Matemwe village.
