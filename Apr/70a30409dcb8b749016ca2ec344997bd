THE National Assembly is considering putting a new borrowing procedure for Members of Parliament (MPs) because the majority of them are overwhelmed by the burden of debts that taxpayers’ money may be used to set off their debts. This was said by National Assembly Speaker, Job Ndugai at a press conference in his office yesterday, adding that most of loan agreements entered by most of the MPs had some defects. He explained that apart from more than 400m/- Arusha Urban Lawmaker (Chadema) Godbless Lema was indebted after borrowing 644m/-, eight other MPs of the Civic United Front (CUF), who were expelled by the party had not settled their debts of more than 1bn/-. The eight MPs from the opposition party were sacked from their party for supporting former CUF Secretary- General Maalim Seif Sharrif Hamad. “We will look into a procedure for Parliament not to guarantee MPs to have large loans. He who wishes to borrow, let him do so on his or her own and Parliament will not need any information about such loans,” the Speaker said. He noted that Parliament was put to the test due to loans borrowed by eight CUF MPs as their debts were more than 1bn/-and there was no possibility for such money to be repaid. The Speaker expressed his fears that taxpayers’ money might be used to repay the debts. The Speaker also used the opportunity to clarify a misleading report on the saga surrounding the Controller and Auditor General (CAG), Prof Mussa Asaad. He said it should be understood that Parliament had no problem with the office of the CAG as an institution. According to him, the problem which is available is Prof Assad as an individual. He noted that the resolution passed had the effect that the National Assembly was not ready to work with the current CAG for giving statements undermining Parliament.
