TANZANIA Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (TCCIA) has acquired 2,000 acres of land at Msele Village in Kwamtoro Ward Chemba District for cassava farming, to provide raw materials for an envisaged cassava processing plant. Dodoma Regional TCCIA Executive Secretary, Mr Idd Senge, told the ‘Daily News’ here yesterday that the plant would be established in Hombolo, on the outskirts of Dodoma City. “The cassava processing plant will produce animal feed and starch. It is expected to produce at least 200 tonnes of animal feed and starch a day,” said the Dodoma Regional Executive Secretary of TCCIA. He was briefing this newspaper on an upcoming visit by a delegation of a US based non-governmental organisation, Episcopal Relief Development (ERP), at the invitation of the Diocese of Central Tanganyika (DCT) Development Services Company. According to Mr Senge, DCT has teamed up with ERP to conduct a special programme to address the impacts of climate change and improve food security in Bahi, Chamwino and Dodoma districts. “Cassava farming is part of implementation of a programme that supports farmers to address the impacts of climate change,” he observed. The Director of DCT’s Development Department, Mr Lister Nyang’anyi, noted in a statement released here yesterday that the ERP delegation, which will be accompanied by experts from the US based Cornell University, will also visit the TCCIA regional office. “The main goal of visiting the TCCIA regional office is to share knowledge and exchange experience with TCCIA on how they support farmers to address challenges posed by climate change,” he said. Mr Nyang’anyi pointed out that while in the country, the ERP delegation plans to conduct a study to establish how the special programme to address the impacts of climate change supported farmers to improve food security.
