A SPECIAL committee has been formed to advice the President of the United Republic of Tanzania on the best way of implementing his directives of leaving villages established in National Park areas. This was said before the National Assembly here by Deputy Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism, Constantine Kanyasu when responding to a question by Ridhiwani Kikwete (Chalinze- CCM). He said that the committee is led by the Minister for Land, Housing and Human Settlement Developments. Other ministries involved in the committee, he said, include the Vice-President’s Office (Environment) and Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism. The rest are Regional Administration and Local Government, Defence Ministry and National Service, Livestock and Fisheries and that of Agriculture and Water. Earlier, the MP had explained at a task force meeting, where the President while with the Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism, Dr Hamisi Kigwangalla and Deputy Minister of Livestock and Fisheries, Abdallah Ulega, directed that villages in national park areas should not be expelled. He therefore wanted to know whether such announcement meant villagers have been allowed to continue with their economic activities in areas they are living and when the government would deal with the border conflicts between the villages and the parks. In his response, the deputy minister said that on January 15, 2019, the President, Dr John Magufuli issued an order of not relocating all 366 villages identified to have border conflicts with national parks. Furthermore, he said the president insisted that through such directive, it does not mean citizens were allowed to invade park areas. The deputy minister disclosed that following the presidential order, a special committee was formed to see the best way of its implementation. Upon completion of the committee’s mandate, he said, the report will be presented to the president and more directives will be given to the citizens.
