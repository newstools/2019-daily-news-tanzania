THE government will give 200m/-to Dodoma Regional Referral Hospital to put up a new Outpatient Department (OPD), building in a bid to cope with a growing population in Dodoma City. Minister for Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, Ms Ummy Mwalimu, gave the promise here yesterday during her visit to a new maternity ward building at the public hospital. “Contrary to the current OPD, the new OPD building will be able to receive a good number of patients,” said the minister during the visit focused on inspecting health services at the maternity wing of the Regional Referral Hospital. Ms Mwalimu directed the hospital’s management to address challenges facing the oldest hospital, pointing out that it should also rename the hospital’s building to address inconveniences among patients. “The hospital’s management should now consider constructing a new Intensive Neonatal Care Unit building and Intensive Care Unit (ICU), building,” she said. On her part, the Permanent Secretary in the Health portfolio, Dr Zainab Chaula, said the health ministry would help the hospital to address the challenges it was facing, saying the government would employ more medical personnel to address shortage of medical staff. “I want to promise you that the government will employ medical staff in different job posts to improve health services,” she said. Dr Chaula laid emphasis on teamwork at the hospital in order to offer health services to people seeking medical services efficiently. Ms Mwalimu was accompanied by senior officials from her ministry, including the Director of Policy and Planning, Mr Edward Mbaga.
