Algeria's President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has announced his resignation after weeks of mass protests, state media report. The Head of State, who has been in power for 20 years, had already dropped plans to seek a fifth term as opposition to his rule grew, BBC has reported. The powerful Algerian army had called for the 82-year-old to be declared incapable of carrying out his duties. The ailing leader suffered a stroke six years ago and has rarely appeared in public since. After the announcement, car horns heard in the streets of the capital, Algiers, as hundreds celebrated the decision reached by the President. According to BBC, people waved Algeria's national flags and sang. Selmaoui Seddik quoted by Reuters saying: "God willing, we will have a 100% democratic transition, this is very important. We need to remove the whole previous regime and that is the hardest thing." One protest leader, Mustapha Bouchachi, said before the announcement that any decision by Mr Bouteflika to quit would still change nothing and that the protests would continue.
