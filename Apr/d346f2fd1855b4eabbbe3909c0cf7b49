THE Minister for Education and Vocational Training, Ms Riziki Pembe Juma, has graced the opening of newly built blocks in North Unguja, expressing her happiness with public support in building the country. She said ordinary citizens have been making a significant contribution through fundraising related to constructing schools and improving infrastructures in their respective areas, a sign of commitment to support the government’s development programmes. “The government is impressed by the steps being taken by ordinary citizens. Sometimes you do not need to wait for the central government to do everything for you. This is good,” Ms Juma said in Gamba village where she graced the opening of a block of five classrooms for students. She said the government under the leadership of President Ali Mohamed Shein has made admirable achievements in education, but efforts by ordinary people are highly recognized and valued. Ms Juma said people’s efforts in improving the learning environment for their children should motivate teachers to explore viable measures that will help improve good performance, ensuring more students pass national examinations. At the colourful event, Mr Mshamara Chumu Kombo, an education officer, North A district administrative council, said the construction of the school block for the classrooms started in 2017 with funds contributed by parents and residents of the area. “We are happy to have these new classrooms because it will minimize students’ congestion in classrooms,” Mr Kombo said as students, through a special message, informed the minister that lack of equipment in their school laboratory affected them in their science subjects.
