NATIONAL senior football team, Taifa Stars Head Coach, Emmanuel Amunike, will head to Cairo, Egypt to attend the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) draws scheduled for tomorrow. Amunike, the former African Footballer of the year, will return to a familiar country Egypt where he started his professional football outside the Nigeria, going back not as a player but as a coach. It could be recalled that he got one of the tickets of AFCON for Taifa Stars after 39 years of absence. Qualified countries will know their opponents as the ceremony of the AFCON draw will take place on Friday. The tournament is schedule to take place from June 21st to July 19th, 2019. Tanzania can’t boast of top stars but they have Amunike - who knows Nigeria’s style of play - as manager, which is an added advantage. The Nigeria-born Tanzania coach has worked with most of the current Super Eagles players; therefore he knows how to prevent them from wreaking havoc against his team in case he is paired against the Super Eagles. Taifa Stars is seeded in fourth pot, which consists of Mauritania, Namibia, Benin, Kenya, and Madagascar. The first pot contains Egypt, Ghana, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Cameroon and Senegal. It consists of major powerhouses in African football but the Teranga Lions of Senegal are the team to avoid. The second pot has Morocco, Nigeria, Algeria, Guinea, Mali and DR Congo, while the third pot contains Uganda, South Africa, Guinea-Bissau, Zimbabwe, Angola and Burundi.
