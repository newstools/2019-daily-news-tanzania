PREVENTION and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB), in Dodoma is investigating 900m/-meant for some development projects after smelling a rat. Speaking to reporters here yesterday, head of PCCB in Dodoma, Mr Sosthenes Kibwengo said the funds were allocated for health, education, water and construction sectors development projects, but leave a lot to be desired. “In the first quarter of the year we investigated 39.8bn/- funds of the development projects, where 900m/-showed signs of corrupt practices, and we are therefore, dealing with the tiny details before further actions” pointed out Mr Kibwengo. Equally, he said, during the same period the bureau managed to save 152.3m/- that was to be paid water projects’ contractors whose jobs were unsatisfactory. However, he hinted that they are carrying on with awareness programmes in the public for the citizens to desist from such misbehaviors in particular, now that the local government polls are on the way. Mr Kibwengo said in the coming period of April to June, this year they will focus much on control and monitoring of development projects funds to ensure that assigned contractors spend well the public resources. In another development, the Dodoma PCCB head called upon the public especially women who are falling prey to sexual extortions to report the cases for effective actions. He added that sexual corruption is a growing trend in colleges, job appointments, in work places amongst others, and advised any victim to tip them or any office for further actions.
