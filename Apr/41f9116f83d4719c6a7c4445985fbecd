DAR ES SALAAM-based duo; Randeep Birdi and Tufail Tufail are now clear favourites for the national championship title after the end of its second round in Kilimanjaro Region. Birdi, who was leading the title race with 25 points at the end of the first round held in Dar es Salaam early March, saw his helm violently shaken in Moshi after Tufail won the second round over the weekend. “The title race is still tight, but I think I will be able to regain the pilot seat in the remaining five rounds of the national rally championship,” said Tufail in Moshi late Sunday. Tufail, the driver of Subaru Impreza, said the second round was very tough despite emerging its winner. “I had to use all tricks to ensure Birdi, who was my closest challenger, doesn’t beat my time. I thank my crew members and sponsors, especially Moil, for the support,” he said. Birdi, however, still leads the seeding points log with 43 points, closely followed by Tufail with 40 points. Birdi began the season with a 25-point haul before adding 18 points in the second round of Kilimanjaro as Tufail collected 15 points in the season opener before adding 25 maximum points he was awarded as round two winner. Also running well, but far behind the front runners are Gurpal Sandhu from Arusha parading 15 points after finishing third in Vaisakhi Rally. Emanuel Lyimo, who finished Vaisakhi Rally at the fourth position, is three points behind Sandhu after collecting 12 points. While the two-driver dominion upfront in other way renew car makers’ challenge. Its Birdi-Tufail showdown for the drivers, but it has become Mitsubishi Evos vs Subaru Impreza in terms of manufacturers. The Mitsubishi Evos vs Subaru Impreza showdown, however, seems to have put Ford Fiesta off mark as the last year’s championship hero, Ahmed Huwel has not entered his car in the competition. Still it can not be put out of chase completely as there are five more rounds remaining and anything can happen.
