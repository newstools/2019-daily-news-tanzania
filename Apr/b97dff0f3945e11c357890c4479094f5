TANZANIA Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (TCCIA) in conjunction with Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) will soon embark on a special programme to donate Electric Fiscal Devices (EFDs) to traders in Dodoma. Dodoma Regional Secretary for TCCIA, Mr Idd Senge, noted here yesterday that the goal of the programme was to increase the scope of traders who are using the device, to improve revenues collection. “At the outset, the programme will target to support at least 1,000 traders. Preparations for the programme have moved into higher gear,” said the Dodoma Regional Secretary for TCCIA. Under the auspices of NBC Bank, the programme beneficiaries will have to open bank accounts in NBC Bank, under which the bank will be deducting some amounts every month to repay the debt. According to Mr Senge, TCCIA would provide TRA with a list of traders for scrutinising traders’ particulars, in order to identify eligible business operators for EFDs application. It has been revealed that, most traders in the region who are supposed to use EFDs are yet to start using the tax collection devices due to limited financial means.
