OVER 98m/- has been disbursed as soft loans to different groups of people with disabilities, Bukoba Municipal Director, Mr Moris Limbe has disclosed. He noted that about 250m/- was set aside during 2018/19 financial year to assist the groups, including young people and women, and urged them to wisely utilise the funds and opportunities in their midst to address poverty in their areas. On his side, Tanzania Federation of Disabled People’s Organisations (SHIVYAWATA), Regional Secretary, Sweetbert Mshanga, said five groups out of seven had already received about 22m/-. Mshanga said that their members are progressing well with the funds in different activities including entrepreneurship, poultry and vegetable production. In another development, the SHIVYAWATA Regional Secretary, appealed to parents and guardians of children with disabilities to avoid hiding them, saying they also have potentials to perform well in life. The secretary, who is also living with disability, told the ‘Sunday News’ that being a physically disabled person does not automatically make one dependent. “Parents should avoid hiding children with disabilities. They have potentials to develop and become future government workers and leaders,” Mshanga said. Equally, the secretary advised them to ensure that such children get equal education like any other pupil, calling upon also the public and private institutions to ensure their buildings are fitted with friendly infrastructures which support such people. “Most of the public buildings including Schools, Libraries and Offices lack infrastructures friendly to people with special needs. This negatively affects and limits their maximum participation,” he said. The SHIVYAWATA is a mouthpiece for matters pertaining to People with Disabilities, established way back in 1992 and brings together ten national organisations - namely Tanzania Albino Society (TAS), Tanzania League of the Blind (TLB) and Tanzania Association of the Physically Handicap (CHAWATA).
