SEVEN thousand and eight hundred people in Kagera Region contract Tuberculosis (TB) every year on average, prompting Dr Paschal Peter, who is based at Bukoba Regional Referral Hospital to call for concerted efforts to curb the spread of the disease. He pointed out that scant knowledge and delays in reporting to health facilities for early detection aggravated efforts in curbing the spread of the disease. The doctor stressed that it was crucial for people to report to health facilities early for testing. He said that of the 7,800 cited cases, only 2,300 patients were treated due to limited capacity and resources. At the national level about 154,000 patients contract TB each year. Dr Peter explained that about 100 Accredited Drug Dispensers (ADOs) and 20 registered traditional healers from Muleba, Missenyi, Ngara and Karagwe councils were recently trained on TB management skills while efforts were being made to mobilise funds to conduct more sensitization seminars on controlling TB. He further explained that the region allocated one Genexpert TB testing machine to each of the regionâ€™s district councils as more efforts were being made to control the spread of the disease as there were indications that the preventable disease was on the increase. The doctor said that between January and March this year, nine patients were confirmed to have contracted Multi-Drugs Resistant (MDR) TB compared to 10 last year. Elaborating, he said that the number of TB patients increased from 1,732 cases detected in 2014 to 1,934 in 2015 and 2,121 in 2016. Figures for 2017 and 2018 were 2,158 and 2,214, while between January and April 1, this year, 441 cases were detected. The prevalence of Tuberculosis in the country was 269/100,000, he said, pointing out that this was an indication that the disease was still a major burden in the country and calls for renewed efforts to strengthen the health delivery system and program interventions. World Tuberculosis Day (WTD) celebrated annually on March 24 is marked to create public common awareness about efforts to combat one of the deadly diseases that is curable with the right administered drugs.
