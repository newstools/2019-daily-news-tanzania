RESIDENTS of Coast Region are set to benefit from implementation of a clean water project worth 14bn/ by the Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority (DAWASA). Speaking over the weekend in Dar es Salaam, DAWASA’s Director of Water Production and Distribution, Engineer Aron Joseph, said the project would benefit the residents of Mlandizi, Chalinze and Mboga. Eng Joseph made the revelation during a visit by some employees of DAWASA and Chalinze Member of Parliament, Mr Ridhiwani Kikwete, at Tanzania Steel Pipes Limited (TSP), which produces pipes for the project. The project will cover 58 kilometres and it will also supply the precious liquid to Mboga industrial park in Coast Region. It will draw water from Upper Ruvu water source and its construction will also involve installation of two water pumping stations. “It will supply 9.3 million litres of water per day and it will have a lifespan of 20 years based on its design. The project is designed to serve a population of 120,912 people,” he explained. According to him, TSP has so far produced 3.7 kilometres of pipes which have been transported to the project area in Mboga and Msoga areas. Mr Kikwete was glad that implementation of the project by DAWASA would address shortage of water faced by residents. “Let me take this opportunity to remind fellow residents in the constituency to promptly pay their water bills once the project becomes operational to support efforts by the government to improve the water sector in the country,” the MP urged. Speaking last month at the climax of Water Week which took place between March 16 and 22 in Dar es Salaam, Eng Joseph said DAWASA was undertaking 10 major water projects to supply water in Dar es Salaam and Coast regions. He assured residents in the two regions that the water projects will be completed by 95 per cent by the year 2020, noting further that DAWASA allocates 35 per cent of its revenues to undertake water projects.
