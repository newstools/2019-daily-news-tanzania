PRESIDENT John Magufuli has ordered the ministries of Industry and Trade and Agriculture to nationalize all previously privatized cashew nut processing industries, but currently dormant. Speaking in Masasi District on Thursday afternoon, while winding up his three-day official visit in Mtwara Region, the President said his regime is motivating farmers to cultivate cashew nuts, despite uncertain markets. “I don’t say privatization was bad decision, but there are people, including a Third Phase government minister, whom the State trustedand handled them the business of processing cashew nut in industries, but they don’t buy cashew nuts, they don’t process cashew nuts,” he pointed out. Without mentioning the name, President Magufulihinted that the bigwig used the industry as a collateral to acquire a loan from a bank and he didn’t develop it, only to transfer the cash to another project. The furious Head of State, thereafter, ordered the Minister for Agriculture to remain in Mtwara to make sure that all idle industries are returned to the government. He said that farmers in the region are motivated, but lack ready market to sell the crop, because some investors are sabotaging the business and its industries by hoarding the factories’ spare parts and selling to the neighboring countries. However, he suggested that the pseudo-investors may be sued in the court for not developing the industries and denyingthe government revenue collections as well as the localsemployment opportunities.
