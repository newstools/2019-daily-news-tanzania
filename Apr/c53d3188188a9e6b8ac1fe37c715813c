A local businessman has filed a notice before the Fair Competition Commission (FCC), opposing the proposed merger of multi-trillion interest rights in three gas blocks offshore in Mtwara between two foreign companies dealing in gas explorations. The FCC announced the proposed merger between Medco Energi Global PTE Limited, based in Singapore, as an acquiring firm and London based Ophir Energy Plc, as the target firm. The businessman, Moto Mabanga requests the FCC not to approve the merger until the pending case and others to be filed are settled. Mabanga’sadvocate, Gabriel Mnyele, the local businessman stated in the notice that there is pending litigation between Ophir with others and him that has direct bearing on the ownership of gas Block 1, Block 2 and Block 4 under which Ophir still owns 20 percent of the interest. He stated that 60 percent interest of gas blocks have been sold by the target firm to British Gas Group Plc, which has also sold all of interest in Tanzania to Royal Dutch Shell Plc in a transaction that was shrouded with secrecy, non-transparency and illegalities. “Further to that 20 percent of the remaining interest was sold to Pavilion Energy. The Ophir wants to sell its remaining 20 percent purposely to avoid liability and attachment of its interest should the objector win the proceedings that are now pending in the Court of Appeal,” Mabanga stated. According to his application, the value of pending litigation is 322 million US dollars of which Ophir are primarily responsible and that if the merger is allowed the objector will have nothing to realize the decree should he win.
