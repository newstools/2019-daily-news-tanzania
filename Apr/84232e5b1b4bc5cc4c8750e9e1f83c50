TANZANIA Communication Regulatory Authority (TCRA) has warned Magic FM radio and Radio Free Africa (RFA) for going against the government’s directives by reading newspapers in detail during their morning newspapers review programmes. The warning was issued in Dar es Salaam yesterday by the Chairperson of the TCRA’s Committee of Contents, Ms Valeria Msoka. She said that the two radio stations have violated the order by the Minister of Information, Arts, Culture and Sports, Dr Harrison Mwakyembe during the Media Day in May 3, 2017. She said TCRA was given the responsibility to write letters to all media outlets with regard to the instruction against reading the newspapers in detail. She added that the TCRA’s Content Committee has advised the two radio stations to appeal within 21 days if they are not satisfied with the decisions. Ms Msoka further said, after reviewing the Magic programme, which aired by the Magic Fm and Good morning Africa by the Radio Free Africa (RFA), the committee has been satisfied that the radio stations went against the government’s directions on the matter. “The committee has learnt that in the programme of Morning Magic by Magic Fm and Good morning Africa by RFA, the radios violated the government’s direction against reading newspapers in detail in the segments of newspapers review instead of reading headings only,” she said. Ms Msoka said the government introduced the directives to protect and maintain the market of print Media. She said representatives from both radio stations were given an opportunity to defend themselves and that her committee listened and analysed their explanations before reaching the decision
