TANZANIA’S Elizabeth Mwakajila has been nominated for the Tourism Star Award gala slated for Lucerne, Switzerland between May 1 and 3 this year. Ms Mwakajila who is also the Project Coordinator at Thomson Safaris, will be honoured by the World Tourism Forum Lucerne (WTFL) in collaboration with Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) for documenting inspiring stories about destination Tanzania and the array of natural resources found in the country. Speaking shortly before presenting her with the national flag ahead of her flight to Lucerne City, Tanzania Tourist Board (TTB) Managing Director, Ms Devotha Mdachi said Ms Mwakajila will be honoured for her selfless efforts in putting the country’s natural resources on the global map. “She has really done us proud, she truly deserves it,” said the TTB boss. According to Ms Mdachi, the award nominee efforts were in line with ‘Tanzania Unforgettable’, a brand campaign to boost the country’s international appeal and visibility. Describing her achievement, Ms Mwakajila said she was able to convince the WTFL jury with her commitment and passion for the work she does in taking the country’s tourism sector to the next level. She said she didn’t take the awards too seriously after it was advertised online, not until she attempted penning down the success stories about Tanzania’s tourism and what the government was doing to promote the $2bn industry.
