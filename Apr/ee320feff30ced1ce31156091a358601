POLICE in Dodoma Region have banned a planned demonstration by ACTWazalendo party today, to pressure Parliament to drop its decision not to work with Controller and Auditor General (CAG) Prof Mussa Assad. Dodoma Regional Police Commander (RPC), Gilles Muroto, told a press conference here yesterday that the authority of Parliament cannot be questioned outside the debating chamber, saying only MPs can question decisions by the legislative body. “Based on information circulating on social media networks on the planned demonstration, police have banned the illegal demonstration. It should be noted that the authority of Parliament cannot be questioned outside the legislative body,” said the RPC. Commander Muroto warned wananchi against participating in the planned demonstration which is reportedly coordinated by youthful members and supporters of ACT-Wazalendo, in conjunction with three other political parties - NCCR- Mageuzi, Chauma and UPDP. “The youth should understand that they constitute the major national workforce upon which the government greatly depends for facilitating the national economy instead of being used by politicians,” he remarked. Commander Muroto urged members of the public to undertake their routine activities today as the Police Force has beefed up security in Dodoma City, saying the force would deploy its officers in all important areas of the City. Meanwhile, the Police has said that the force has beefed security in the city ahead of the Easter holiday to enable the city residents celebrate the festival peacefully. According to the Dodoma Regional Police Commander, the force would increase patrols and deploy its officers to entertainment centres.
