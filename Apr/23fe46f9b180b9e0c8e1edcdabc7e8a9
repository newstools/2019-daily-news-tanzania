THE Presence of many new sponsors likely to spice up competition in this year’s Chief Executives Officers (CEOs) Retreat Golf Day and billed as big step forward. The annual tournament organised and coordinated by Sea Cliff Resort and Spa Golf Club of Zanzibar is open for CEOs and diplomats golfers from around the globe. The 18-hole stable ford tournament is scheduled to tee off on July 29 this year at the par 72 club course in Mangapwani, Zanzibar. Elias Soka, the club’s golf club manager, told the ‘Daily News’ from Zanzibar yesterday that preparation for the annual event is on a top gear. He said that they are delighted to see the event attracting more sponsors, joining usual sponsors such as Turkish Airline, Mali Spa and many others. “We are delighted to see the two firms on board as our latest sponsors and their presence at tournament’s sponsorship wagon is very welcome. We are grateful for their tireless support as it is not first time they did in this year’s event,” said Soka. Soka added that Turkish Airline entry has been a massive boost since it attracts many top golfers especially from around the World, who frequently travel to Zanzibar for the event. He said that they have now joined White Sand Hotel, Sayona and Sea Cliff Resort & Spa Zanzibar who were the first to sponsor the prestigious event. Soka stressed that early preparations have already started to pay off as they gear up to have a CEO’s luxury retreat golf tournament a huge success. The manager said that so far they have received confirmation from 20 CEOs as registration is already opened. Soka has called upon golfers to confirm participation at the tournament since the club has prepared a wonderful hospitality that will make them enjoy competing and staying in Zanzibar.
