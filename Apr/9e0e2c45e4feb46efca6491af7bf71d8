THE Minister for Education and Vocational Training, Ms Riziki Pembe Juma, has warned head teachers in public schools to stop demanding fees and any forms of contributions from students or their parents, as education in public nursery, primary and secondary schools was free. “We are now implementing the ‘Free education policy’ that was re-launched by President Ali Mohamed Shein, but some head teachers are asking students to contribute money for school projects. This should stop,” Ms Juma said. The minister made the remarks during a meeting with head teachers from public schools in Unguja Island, emphasizing that students are supposed to enjoy free education covering nursery, primary and secondary levels. She said head teachers were responsible for ensuring that children enjoy the free education and that the government was fully committed to ensuring that all children attend school and get quality education. “The government has been providing enough funds meant for the free education program in all public schools, and so there is no need for students to pay fees or any contribution. No teacher should seek money from students, and whoever does would risk harsh penalty,” Ms Riziki remarked. Parents and students have supported the sentiments, as they had been subjected to demands for monetary contributions for under the cover of development fund. Meanwhile, the minister has discouraged mixing female and male students during extra classes (tuition sessions), that were not coordinated by teachers, as this created risks for them to engage in sexual mischief. The sessions or study camps were particularly common closer to national examinations. “Do not mix male and female students and leave them to study alone. A teacher must be present,” Ms Riziki told the head teachers as she introduced the newly appointed Deputy Minister, Mr Simai Mohamed Said, who appealed to teachers to remain patriotic despite the challenges they were facing.
