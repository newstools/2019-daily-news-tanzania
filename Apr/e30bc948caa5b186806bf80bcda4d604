FORMER Controller and Auditor General (CAG), Mr Ludovick Utouh has urged women in the accountancy profession to participate in politics so that they can have a bigger impact in the development of the country as well as gender equality. Mr Utouh made the call in Dar es Salaam yesterday when officiating at Tanzania Association of Women Certified Accountants (TAWCA) Second Forum organized to discuss on women development in the country. "Women, especially professional ones, should think of joining politics and compete for parliamentary seats in order to help in various development matters discussed and deliberated by the parliament," he said, adding that professional womenâ€™s participation is highly needed at the parliament, which helps in the country's law and regulations. He encouraged the members of TAWCA to join politics and compete for parliamentary seats in the coming general election so that they can have a better chance to help in enhancing the country's development. On the other hand, Mr Utouh said that women have a bigger role to play in the development of the country's vision of developing the state into an industrial country. "Women are very powerful, especially when it comes to management of resources, they tend to be well organized and keen in the development and management of resources" he said. He called for the government and the private sector in the country to always consider and give women leadership positions, arguing that women perform better in terms of development and management of resources. He pointed out that various researches conducted indicate that women perform better than men in leadership positions and thus stand in a better position to be given opportunities to lead, especially at this time when the nation is developing into an industrial nation. Speaking during the forum, the Chairman of the Association, Ms Neema Kiure-Mssusa said that the second forum aims at discussing and deliberating on challenges that women accountants face in matters pertaining to leadership.
