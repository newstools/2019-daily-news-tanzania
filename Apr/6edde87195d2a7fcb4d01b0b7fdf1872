THE authorities in Pemba are complaining that government’s efforts to improve education in the country is being hampered by poor attendance in schools linked to engaging children in bungo fruit harvesting. Mr Rashid Hadid Rashid, District Commissioner (DC) for Chakechake said in a meeting with parents, teachers and local leaders that concerted efforts are urgently required to stop absenteeism in schools. “It is unfortunate that absenteeism is high in the district. About 120 children missing class frequently at Chanjamjawir school is unacceptable. We see many children being involved in the harvesting of bungo fruits. This must stop,” Mr Rashid said. The Bungo fruit (Saba comorensis) or fruit of a ‘rubber vine’ is a rare species grown and also wildly found in forests mainly in Pemba. Because of its delicious juice, the demand for bungo fruit is high and the price is good, therefore both adults and children get engaged in the business during the season. The DC warned parents and other adults against hiring school going children in bungo fruit harvesting and cloves picking, ignoring the national campaign to motivate and support children to attend school and take education seriously. Most families in Pemba are regarded as poor, an excuse many parents use for absenteeism in school because their children have to look for petty work such crops harvesting, fish cleaning at the beaches and farming to earn money to support their families.
