PRIME Minister Kassim Majaliwa has expressed satisfaction on drill being carried out by the National Under-17 team, Serengeti Boys who have camped in Rwanda for the AFCON U-17 duels. Speaking at the camp yesterday, Majaliwa told Tanzanians to bank on the team and urged players to continue training seriously ahead of the event which Tanzania hosts in Dar es Salaam starting this weekend. The PM and his entourage visited the team’s camp after Serengeti Boys won FERWAFA Invitational U-17 tournament that pays homage to Rwanda genocide victims. “Tanzanians bank on you, while everyone is praying for your success. You have to fight hard and win so that Tanzania gets a ticket to play in the World Cup finals for U-17 players,” said the PM. Morever, the PM also hailed Serengeti Boys for winning various international events including the just concluded Ferwafa U-17 invitational tournament. Responding, the team handed over the PM a coveted trophy they won in the Ferwafa Invitational competition. Earlier the PM thanked Tanzanian ambassador to Rwanda Ernest Mangu and Tanzanians residing in Rwanda for supporting the team during the tournament. Serengeti Boys, for that matter, won the tournament’s trophy, given they cruised to a -1 win over Cameroon in the first match. Rwanda’s Junior Wasps, coached by Yves Rwasamanzi, struck a last minute free kick to earn the draw, courtesy of a well taken Rodrigue Isingizwe’s free kick which secured a point for the hosts, who finished bottom of the standings with one point following a 3-1 opening loss against Cameroon. Serengeti Boys fought back from -0 down to take the lead at the Nyamirambo Stadium before they eventually settled for a draw. Meanwhile, teams from Morocco and Cameroon arrived yesterday in Dar es Salaam, ahead of the AFCON U-17 finals. Other countries are due in the city today.
