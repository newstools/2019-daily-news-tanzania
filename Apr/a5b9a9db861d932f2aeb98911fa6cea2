SIMBA has stepped up preparations for the return leg of CAF Champions League quarter finals against TP Mazembe in Lubumbashi, DR Congo this Saturday. Simba who were held to a barren draw by Mazembe over the weekend at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam were scheduled to be back in local league action yesterday but their game against struggling Biashara United was cancelled to give the Reds ample time to prepare for CAF assignment. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Tanzania Premier League Board (TPLB) confirmed that the match which was to be held at the Jamhuri Stadium in Morogoro has been pushed forward and a new date will be fixed. Simba resumed training at the Boko Veteran ground on the outskirt of Dar es Salaam immediately after the first leg against multiple continental champions. Patrick Aussems side is expected to jet off to Lubumbashi tomorrow, where they will have to avoid defeat and score, to stand any chance of making it to the semifinals. Any draw involving goals will be enough to see Simba through into the semifinal, while a barren draw will see the teams separated on penalties. Meanwhile, reports had it that Simba leadership are in the process to renew contract talks with some of key players in the club. According to reports, contracts of eight of the club’s stars will expire at end of this season and the club’s Chairman, Swedy Mkwabi said that they are about to commence discussions of contract renewal with the players. The players are Emmanuel Okwi, John Bocco, Jonas Mkude, Aishi Manula, Erasto Nyoni, James Kotei, Asante Kwasi and Shomari Kapombe.
