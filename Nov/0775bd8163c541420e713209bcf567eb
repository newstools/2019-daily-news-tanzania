AMANA Bank, in marking eight years of its operations in the country, has begun preparations to expand its wings to Dodoma in supporting government’s move to shift its base to the city. The bank announced on Wednesday that it was on the move to open up its new branch in Dodoma next year, thus making a total of operating 10 branches. The new branch in Dodoma will come next after recent launching of 9th branch in Zanzibar, in efforts to bring its services closer to the customers. Head of Marketing Department, Mr Dassu Mussa, revealed new plans in Dar es Salaam when speaking to the journalists. His statement came following celebrations to mark customer week last week along with marking of 8th birthday of the bank. The colorful event was held over the last weekend at the bank’s head office in the city. The bank assured that it has continued with efforts to beef up its capacity to enable customers access services easily.

When commemorating customers’ week, the bank conducted awareness education to parents and guardians over education facilitation that the bank provides to relief its customers from a burden of paying school fees. On his part, the bank’s Executive Director Dr Muhsin Masoud said the bank celebrated the customers’ week with a theme: ‘Tabasamu lako, Furaha yetu’ (your smile is our happiness). “The theme intended to motivate performance and creativity as solution to make customers get better financial services that meet needs of Tanzanians of both middle and low class, particularly those seeking small loans for business, education and others,” he said.
