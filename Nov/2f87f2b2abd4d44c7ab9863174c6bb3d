UN Women, in partnership with the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children and the Women in Law and Development in Africa (WILDAF), has launched a social media campaign, which is set to run through 16 days of activism against gender-based violence (GBV) starting today. The social media campaign targets over 23 million internet users and about five million people who are active on social media in Tanzania to regularly provide and receive information in real time on activities taking place in various parts of the country. UN Women Country Representative Hodan Addou said in Dar es Salaam at the weekend that according to the demographic and health survey of 2015/16, about 40 per cent of women aged 15-49 years have experienced physical violence while 17 per cent are survivors of sexual violence. “There are indications that cases are increasing as reflected during a recent three-day seminar held in Dodoma, targeting members of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Social Services and Development to discuss the acceleration of the implementation of the national plan of action to end violence against women and children,” she said. However, she added, it was the first time for UN Women and partners to launch a social media campaign, which would uniquely include the participation of celebrities, champions and other public opinion influencers fighting against GBV. It was further noted that such an initiative came just a few days before the launch of International Day of the Elimination of Violence against Women to be held in Dodoma tomorrow. This year’s theme is: “Orange the World: Generation Equality Stands against Rape”. The launch will mark the beginning of a series of activities that will run through a 16-day period across the country. The activities focus on various issues including, providing capacity building to police officers working at police gender and children’s desks, youth dialogue sessions and debates in areas such as Kakonko District, two-day engagement with more than 300 traditional leaders in Mwanza, issues around the safety of women and girls in tertiary institutions and in the workplace such as tea plantations in Njombe and Mufindi District.
