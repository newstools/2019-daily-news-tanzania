ZANZIBAR is still unable to perform kidney transplants due to lack of experts and facilities, Deputy Minister for Health Ms Harusi Said Suleiman, informed the House on Friday. However, she promised that the medical process will be possible in the near future after the envisaged construction of a modern hospital at Binguni in Unguja Central district. Some legislators had asked why Mnazi Mmoja Hospital was not performing kidney transplants. “Currently, Mnazi Mmoja Hospital has only been providing dialysis services since 2017. Those requiring transplants are referred to Dar es Salaam or abroad,” the deputy minister said, adding that, on average, 18 kidney dialysis are conducted per week. Dialysis and kidney transplantation are treatments for severe kidney failure, as the kidneys lose their ability to function, and fluid, waste products, and electrolytes begin to build up in the blood.
