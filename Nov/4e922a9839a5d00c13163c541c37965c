THE Deputy Minister for Transport and Communications, Atashasta Nditiye, has urged Ugandans to start using Kilimanjaro and Dares- Salaam airports as connection hubs in their flights to China. “Now that the state carrier, Air Tanzania, is planning direct trips to China, Ugandans that are planning to travel to the Far East can make use of any of the three Tanzanian terminals as connection hub to Guangzhou,” he said. Nditiye was speaking during the occasion in which a Uganda Airlines plane was making its maiden landing at Kilimanjaro International Airport with its midday water salute marking the unveiling of its new route in the Northern Tanzania circuit. With a fleet of 13 aircrafts, KIA will be the Uganda Airlines’ second Tanzanian destination after Dar-es-salaam with the third route set to be soon unveiled in Zanzibar. The state owned company lists 25 other projected routes around the globe. The Ugandan Minister for Works and Transport, Bagiire Aggrey Henry, who accompanied the Uganda Airlines Bombardier CR 900 aircraft maiden landing at Kilimanjaro, said the company was intending to make good use of the tourism potential in Arusha and Kilimanjaro regions.
