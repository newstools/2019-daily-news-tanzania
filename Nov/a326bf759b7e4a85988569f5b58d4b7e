THE Executive Secretary of National Examinations Council of Tanzania (Necta), Dr Charles Msonde has challenged schools in the country to form cooperation that could link teachers, parents and pupils for the betterment of academic performance and discipline in schools. "Cooperation among teachers, parents and pupils or students is a practical mechanism to stimulate academic performance. I also congratulate Ihsan Secondary School on having a good system," Dr Msonde said. Speaking at the first graduation ceremony of Ihsan Secondary School located in Kigamboni, Dar es Salaam, yesterday, the Necta boss said all schools that had a system of cooperation excelled in academic performance. According to Dr Msonde, cooperation among teachers, parents and students helps to build partisanship and discipline, which in turn results in having good citizens who stand a better chance to contribute significantly to socioeconomic development. The colourful ceremony, which attracted parents from different parts of the country, saw 56 students graduating among them 30 were boys and 26 were girls. Earlier, School Head Master, Dr Hashimu Saiboko, said the schoolâ€™s development and its journey since its inception in 2016 was towards supporting the fifth phase government under leadership of President John Magufuli to turn Tanzania into a middle income and industrial economy by 2025. "We started in a very humble beginning with a lot of challenges, but with support and cooperation from parents and well-wishers we managed to overcome them all," Dr Saiboko told the cheerful gathering. "We are optimistic that the school is on track. We work closely with parents and the community surrounding the school," he said, noting that the school had 352 students. Dr Saiboko said the school management planned to start Advanced Level classes in 2020/21 following requests from parents who wanted the school to also utilise such area of expansion venture.
