THE National Environment Management Council (NEMC) has expressed satisfaction with the ongoing Nyerere Hydropower Project saying it has considered all pre-cautions in preserving environment. NEMC Director General, Dr Samuel Gwamaka  said during his tour at the site that the ongoing construction does not affect environment and that all procedures, principles and regulations are followed as required. The project is carried out by JV Arab Contractors and Elsewedy Electric. “This project, upon its completion is expected to generate 2115 MW, it is a big project therefore it is our responsibilities to keep on making visit and inspection so that there could be no negative impact to our environment and animals,” said Dr Gwamaka. He said NEMC has formed a special zone at the project area to oversee all ongoing construction activities. “NEMC has camped here, our aim is to make sure we provide environmental education and make a close follow up on all issues related to environment,” he said. According to Dr Gwamaka, the project is crucial to the country since it is expected to ensure supply of power, which is basic to the country’s economic growth. “I urge everyone to work hard so that this project could be completed on time, it is a crucial project to our economy and welfare,” he noted. Nyerere Hydropower Project is a 2,115 megawatts (2,836,000 hp) hydroelectric dam under construction. The power station is expected to produce 5,920GWh of power annually.
