THE Director for Public Prosecutions (DPP) has pledged to appeal a court ruling that dismissed economic sabotage case against former Kagera Regional Administrative Secretary (RAS), Amantius Msole. Kagera State Attorney Ms Chema Maswi told the ‘Daily News’ that they had already requested the Bukoba Resident Magistrate’s court, which ruled the case in favour of Mr Msole, to supply them a written copy of proceedings and the ruling for appeal process. “We are in the process to file an appeal against the ruling reached by the regional magistrate court,” she revealed. Resident Magistrate Joseph Luambano ruled that the prosecution, through 12 witnesses who testified in court, failed to make out a “prima facie” case sufficiently requiring Msole and two other accused persons to give their defence evidence. He instantly discharged them on no case to answer. Other accused with 56- year old Msole before Resident Magistrate Joseph Luambano in Economic Case No 6/2018 were former Kagera Regional Chief Accountant, Simbaufoo Swai (53), and CRDB Bukoba Branch Manager, Karlo Sendwa (56). Earlier, Ms Maswi had informed the court that in the first offence, the three accused are jointly charged with abuse of position contrary to Section 31 of the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Act No 11 of 2007. The particulars of the offence indicate that on September 19, 2016 within the Municipality and District of Bukoba, the accused intentionally abused their positions in discharge of their functions for purposes of obtaining undue advantage for themselves by opening an Account No 0150225617300 named “Kamati ya Maafa Kagera” at CRDB Bank, Bukoba Branch. According to Ms Maswi, the Prime Minister had directed the Kagera regional authorities to open official Account No 0152225617300 at CRDB Bank, Bukoba Branch to collect donations towards the support of Kagera earthquake victims. Mr Maswi further told the court that between September 23 and 24, 2016 Msole and Swai misused their office contrary to Section 17/2005 of the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Act by purchasing various merchandise worth 11,121,565/- from Krupa General Stores, contrary to the Public Procurement Act, obtaining undue advantages. In the third count, it was alleged that between September 23 and 24, 2016 Msole and Swai misused their office by buying coffins and shroud bundles worth 1,975,000/- from Fortunatus Mbeyanga, without the consent from the Regional Tender Board (RTB). The accused pleaded “not guilty” to the charges. Msole and Swai were being represented by Bukobabased Advocate Josephat Rweyemamu, while Sendwa was being represented by Advocate Aaron Kabunga.
