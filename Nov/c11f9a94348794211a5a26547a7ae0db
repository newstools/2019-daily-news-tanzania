A crucial meeting was on Wednesday held in Tarime to deliberate on measures that will help eliminate Gender Based Violence (GBV) and violence against children in Tarime District Council. The one-day meeting held in Tarime was organized by Plan International in collaboration with Tarime District Council. It involved members of the district women and children protection committee and a good number of representatives from key stakeholders fighting GBV acts and other major issues affecting women and children in the district. Forced Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) and child marriage remain critical challenges facing women and school girls in the district where a large part of the community still see FGM as an important culture. Plan International is one of the key partners working hard with the government through Tarime district council to protect women and children against GBV acts. “Plan International is our big stakeholder on issues affecting children, like FGM and child marriage”, Ms Siwema Sylvester, the secretary of women and children protection committee in Tarime district council said. The meeting reached a number of resolutions that will make the protection of women and children in the district active as part of the measures to eliminate GBV and violence against children. Speaking shortly after the meeting, Plan International Coordinator in Tarime, Mr Shaban Shaban said: “What we have discussed today is in line with the national plan of action that aims to eliminate GBV with the aim of protecting women and children."
