BENJAMIN Mkapa Hospital (BMH) in conjunction with the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR), plans to undertake an infection control and intervention research project in the health facility. The hospital’s Head of Quality Assurance, Dr Bushi Lugoba, noted on Thursday that the project is part of implementation of the directives by the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children to enhance infection control and intervention. “The Ministry had directed all hospitals to strengthen infection control and intervention in their places. The project therefore is implementation of the directives,” said the hospital’s Head of Quality Assurance after a meeting with NIMR. The one-day round table discussion between the two public institutions also involved officials from the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children and the World Surgical Infection Society (WSIS), which is a collaborating partner in the project. Dr Lugoba observed that the meeting was held following ongoing consultations on potential infection control and prevention programmes between NIMR, BMH team and officials from the Ministry and WSIS. On his part, NIMR acting Director for Dodoma Regional Centre, Dr Lucas Matemba, said the aim of the meeting was to discuss current programme plans and seek guidance from the ministry. “We had a fruitful meeting with BMH team today (Thursday) on plans to execute an infection control and intervention project,” said the senior official from NIMR.
