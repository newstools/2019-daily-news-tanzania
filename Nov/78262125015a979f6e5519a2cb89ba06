CRDB Bank is tipped to become the largest bank in the country in terms profit and assets this year if maintained similar good results docked in last three quarters. The lender registered significant increases in gross profit margin and net profit margin to 27 per cent and 19per cent from 20 per cent and 14 per cent respectively. Tanzania Securities said in Quarter Three Commentary for CRDB that the lender has posted a strong performance especially when compared to the results of other banks. “We anticipate that CRDB could become the best performing bank of the year in terms of profit and assets size,” Tanzania Securities, one of the oldest stock brokerage firm, said. T he increase in earnings per share by 35.2 per cent to 11/90 might attract more investors to invest in the bank. “These results may act as a catalyst for the bank’s performance at the bourse [DSE] especially now that the stock is trading well below its intrinsic value,” the brokerage firm said. Tanzania Securities reiterated their ‘buy’ recommendation on the stock at target price of 280/-. CRDB stock closed at 100/- on Tuesday. Kenya based two stock analysts from Exotic Capital and Egyptian Financial Group-Hermen Holding recommended ‘buy’ at target price of between 150/-and 300/-. Orbit Securities’ Market Analyst Imani Muhingo strongly recommended ‘buy’ for CRDB share, especially after the past seven quarter performance. He said CRDB net profit to September grew by 76 per cent to 92.16bn/-. In the first nine months of this year net profit is already 43per cent higher than the whole of last year. “I would say CRDB has fully recovered from the financial sector shake up brought by the fifth government reformation and crackdown on corruption, drug abuse and ghost workers,” Mr Muhingo said. The CRDB’s total assets dropped marginally to 6.2tri/- from 6.3tri/-, but still enabled the bank to recapture its title as Tanzania’s largest bank by assets, after edging out NMB Bank by almost 100m/-.
