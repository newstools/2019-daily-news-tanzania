REVENUE collections on products which are subjected to excise duty have continued to increase since implementation of the Electronic Tax Stamp (ETS) management system which replaced the physical paper stamps. Speaking in an interview recently, the Commissioner for Domestic Revenue at the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA), Mr Abdul Mapembe, said the authority registered an increase of 35 per cent in revenues since the system was introduced. Mr Mapembe explained that the tax collector recorded an increase of 9.130b/-in excise and value added tax (VAT) on spirits and wines between July and September, this year. The first phase of ETS was rolled out by a Swiss firm, Société Industrielle et Commercial de Products Alimentaires (SICPA) in January 15 while the second phase was introduced in August, this year. During the first phase, the electronic stamp devices were installed in 19 industrial plants which produce alcoholic beverages while the second phase covered carbonated soft drinks and bottled water. The ETS system enables the government to use modern technology to obtain production data on a timely basis from manufacturers and thus curb cheating through use of physical stamp papers. The Commissioner explained that TRA was able to record an increase of 17.9 per cent on soft drinks in which it collected 19.049bn/- between July and September, this year, compared to 16.155bn/- during the same period last year. On cigarettes, TRA collected 56/680bn/-between July and September against 53, 656bn/-which was collected last year, representing an increase of 3.024bn/- which is 5.8 per cent. During the same period, excise duty for locally produced spirits and wines increased by 44 per cent, he explained, in which excise duty of the beverages increased to 28.487bn/- from 19.793bn/- during the same period last year. On the other hand, VAT increased from 6.038bn/-to 6.474bn/-, translating to an increase of 435.9m/- which is 7.2 per cent increment.
