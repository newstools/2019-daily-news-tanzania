AFTER scoring against Liverpool at Anfield on Tuesday, KRC Genk striker from Tanzania, Mbwana Samatta is now needed to lead Taifa Stars in their group L match against Equatorial Guinea on November 15th in Dar es Salaam. Samatta scored an equalizer for KRC Genk when his team lost 2-1 to Liverpool. His goal was very superb. Samatta flew to the front post and powered home a corner to punish Liverpool, who totally switched off. In truth it was a mad minute or so for Liverpool, who allowed Genk to whip an initial cross in from the right, which Alexander- Arnold got a crucial touch on to intervene to take the ball away from Samatta, conceding a corner in the process. But then Liverpool allowed Samatta a second bite of the cherry and the Tanzanian unmistakably finished. Samatta is one of the key players named in the 27-member squad announced on Wednesday by Coach Etienne Ndayiragije for Equatorial Guinea mission. Other nations pooled in group L besides Tanzania and Equatorial are Tunisia and Libya. The same squad according to Ndayiragije will face Libya on November 19th in Tripoli.
