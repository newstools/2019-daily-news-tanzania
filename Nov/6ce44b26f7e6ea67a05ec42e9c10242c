PLANS are underway for the importation of a modern crane from Poland, with extraordinary lifting capabilities which will be used in the ongoing project for the construction of silos storing facilities, if the ministry of Finance disburses about US Dollars 1.8 million (4.16bn/-) to a Polish company executing the project. The governments of Tanzania and Poland are currently implementing the US Dollars 33 million project for the construction of silos storing facilities in Dodoma, Songea, Makambako, Mbozi and Shinyanga, which are expected to decrease the levels of grain wastage in the country which is currently estimated at 40per cent. In an interview with the ‘Daily News’ yesterday, the Country Director of Feerum Spolka Akcyjna, a Polish company, Mikolaj Kucia, said the implementation of the project had reached 65per cent, but he was quick to point out that unprecedented delays in the disbursement of funds from the government had paralysed business in the project. According to him, for activities to continue at different sites, the government needs to expedite disbursement of funds so that the project can be accomplished on time. Initially, the project which begun mid last year, was set to be completed in mid-December 2019. However, delays in disbursement of funds made it impossible, adding that his company which is the main contractor, will accomplish the project next year. Feerum Spolka Akcyjna, a Polish joint-stock company with decades of experience in providing storing technologies in a number of successful projects worldwide, including the most recent major project in Ukraine with a storing capacity of 800,000 tonnes.
