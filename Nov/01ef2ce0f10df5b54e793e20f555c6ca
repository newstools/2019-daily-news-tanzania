THE National Environment Management Council (NEMC) has issued a stern warning against individuals who disregard environmental laws and continue investing and building along lakes, rivers and ocean. NEMC Director General, Dr Samuel Gwamaka said some people had continued to build structures in various parts of the country without considering environment impact assessment and warned that the time will come when the law will take its course. “NEMC would like to inform all people who build houses on lakes and ocean shores to contact NEMC officials in their areas for environment impact assessment. He said whoever build structure along the mentioned areas should follow procedures including, securing the environmental clearances from the regulator. “It has come to our attention that most of the people build houses in those areas without setting up required drainage system, and thus ended up littering the water to beaches,” he claimed. NEMC will send its experts across the country for environment impact assessment in all areas along rivers, lakes and the ocean, said Dr Gwamaka, adding; environmental law breakers should brace themselves for 30m/- cash penalty. “The law prohibits people to build houses on the banks of rivers, the buildings are allowed at 60 metres from the rivers, lakes and the ocean. We recognize the importance of the investments on the beaches and along rivers in bringing revenues to the government, but we are going to do our job without considering the rank or status of any person, we want the laws and regulations to be observed,” he said. Dr Gwamaka expressed concerns over directing waste water to the ocean, saying it posed a huge risk for living organisms found in the sea and warned people who continue with what he described as illegal practices
