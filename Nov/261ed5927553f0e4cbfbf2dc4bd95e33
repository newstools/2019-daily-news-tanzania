ICT experts have emphasised on the necessity of getting back to basics for spectrum planning and forward-thinking business strategy to prevent 5G tech to simply turn to mantras for the modern world. Huawei Senior Consultant for Southern Africa Region, Marius Engelbrecht, said forward-thinking in resource allocation and business decision-making is critical to unleashing 5G potential for development. “To boost the innovation-driven development at national, organizational and individual level, it is important to plan resources such as spectrum in a future-oriented way so the scattered resource could be integrated and allocated to where there is the most growth potential,” Mr Engelbrecht said in  speech after the annual ICT Conference (TAIC) in Dar es Salaam. Also, he said in order to maximize the benefits of 5G and its associated services the Tanzania government has an important role to play in ensuring the telecoms environment created are fair and competitive. He said GDP growth in Africa is critical and technology is the enabler that will translate into new jobs and opportunities, lifting citizens out of poverty and allowing them to participate in the economy. “Service innovation and demand are the only way to prove 5G capabilities. “[But] for the industry, it is also important to keep 5G in mind while migrating to 4G,” he said. The regulator, TRCA, has the responsibility to make the spectrum resources viable and available so as to spread the effect-off to multiple users countrywide. The Tanzania ICT Conference is a platform created to offer industry players a unique opportunity to review progress and plan for the future. The number of people Tanzania who are using the internet has crossed 23 million.
