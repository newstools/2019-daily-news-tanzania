STATE Minister (Union affairs) in the Second Vice- President’s Office, Mr Mohamed Aboud Mohamed, has asked members of the Zanzibar House of Representatives to be patient as his office discusses with authorities in the Union government on how Zanzibar will also benefit from the dividends recently received by President John Magufuli. “We are on the right track as far as the Union is concerned. So we will discuss with our colleagues to ensure that Zanzibar also benefits from dividends, particularly from Union public institutions serving in the Isles,” Mr Mohamed said. His remarks were in reaction to a question from Dr Mohamed Said Mohamed ‘Dimwa’, over what share Zanzibar would get from the dividends, because some of them were operating in the Isles. Last Tuesday, Dr Magufuli received more than 2bn/= from different institutions as dividend, urging other companies and institutions that don’t pay dividend to do so.
