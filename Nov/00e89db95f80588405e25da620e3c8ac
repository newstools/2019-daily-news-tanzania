TANZANIA dropped one position in latest FIFA rankings to settle 134 after collecting 1089 points from 1084 they collected previously. Uganda remained the highest positioned CECAFA member nation in FIFA rankings as they stand at 77 position with 1321 points. They moved up two places. Kenya scaled up by two slots to 106 after they collected 1199 points, up from 1195 points they collected previously. Equatorial Guinea who are in the same group with Tanzania in 2021 Africa Cup of nations (AFCON) qualifiers are placed 145, dropping down 10 places. Taifa Stars beat Equatorial Guinea 2-1 in group J of the qualifiers at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam two weeks ago. Tunisia, who are also in the same group with Tanzania moved up two slots to 27th in the World. Libya who beat Tanzania 2-1 last week are placed 101, moving up two places. While the latest edition of the FIFA ranking bears the marks of no fewer than 177 A-level international matches, there is little evidence of that fixture glut in the ladder’s upper echelons. The top five remains unchanged and there is only one change in the top ten, with Croatia (6th, up 1) climbing for the second successive edition at the expense of Portugal (7th, down 1). There are, however, more significant changes further down the table, with Italy (13th, up 2), Poland (19th, up 2), Serbia (29th, up 4) and Nigeria (31st, up 4) pushing their way upwards. The FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™ qualifiers in Asia have also made an impression. Myanmar (136th, up 11), for example, are the only team to have advanced more than 10 positions, having done so thanks to impressive wins over Nepal (170th, down 3), Tajikistan (121st, down 5) and Mongolia (190th, down 4). Kuwait (147th, up 9) also made a substantial jump on the back of their fine results in the Qatar 2022 preliminaries. Yet perhaps the most significant success story of this edition is Venezuela (25th, up 1). While their rise might be more modest than others, La Vinotinto – due largely to a recent friendly victory over Japan (28th, unchanged) – have now ascended to their highest position since the Ranking was introduced in 1993. The next FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking will be published on 19 December 2019.
