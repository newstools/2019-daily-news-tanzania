 THE Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority (Ewura) has reduced fuel adulteration in the country from 78 per cent in 2007 to 4 per cent this year.  The impressive development in the country’s fuel industry has been attained due to a decision by the authority to adopt the use of Bulk Procurement System (BPS) in importation of the vital commodity. Moreover, BPS, which was designed by the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM) and then jointly agreed and put into practice by Ewura, in cooperation with Energy Ministry, has so far enabled Ewura to save 121.6bn/- between 2012 and 2013. Ewura Acting Director-General Nzinyagwa Mchany said during a media briefing that the system equally saw Ewura lower the cost of transporting fuel to 81.9bn/- and the cost of demurrage to 25.7bn/- in two years. He added that since Ewura opted to shift from a cost, insurance and freight system to delivery at port in fuel importation, losses have been contained. The acting DG was briefing reporters on Ewura’s success stories and challenges, as well as gathering key recommendations and experiences from members of various media outlets in the capital city. “Other key achievements we have attained through the BPS system include availability of reliable statistics on shipments of all petroleum products being imported in the country,” he noted. He added that since September 2010, Ewura had embarked on an innovative fuel- marking programme, code-named ‘DNA’, to check fuel dumping, which he said had positive results. “According to research by UDSM over uses of the DNA programme between 2010 and 2013 has increased tax revenue to state coffers at 468.50bn/-,” he insisted. Statistics show that fuel adulteration used to deny the government 300bn/- in a year.
