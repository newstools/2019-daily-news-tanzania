THE value of goods and services exports rose by 5.2 percent to over 21tri/-(9,205.2 million US dollars) in the year ending September due to increase in services receipts and value of non-traditional goods exports. The Bank of Tanzania (BoT) monthly economic review for October the export of nontraditional goods was 9.18tri/-(3,991.9 million US dollars), higher than 7.41tri/- (3,222.1 million US dollars) in the corresponding period in 2018. Earnings from all major categories of non-traditional goods exports increased, except for fish and fish products, and re-exports. Export of gold accounted for 48.6 percent of nontraditional goods exports and increased by 26.1 percent to 4.46tri/-(1,940.3 million US dollars) on account of volume and price effects. Export value of manufactured goods grew by 32.6 percent to 2.37tri/-(1,032.4 million US dollars), driven by exports of sisal products, iron and steel, glass and glassware, manufactured tobacco, and fertilizers. Traditional goods exports declined to 1.29tri/-(563.5 million US dollars) in the year ending September from 2.66tri/-(1,160.8 million US dollars) in the corresponding period in 2018, as all traditional goods declined, save for coffee and tea. Cashew nuts exports, in particular, decreased owing to a fall in prices in the world market and volume due to delays in exporting after government intervention to safeguard farmersâ€™ earnings. It is estimated that about 90,000 tonnes of cashew nuts stock for the 2018/19 crop-season were exported in August and September this year. Exports of coffee and tea improved, supported by favourable weather conditions. Foreign exchange earnings from services amounted to 9.64tri/-(4,194.3 million US dollars) in year ending September compared with 9.04tri/-(3,930.8 million US dollars) in thecorresponding period in 2018, largely driven by tourism. Receipts from tourism accounted for 61.8 percent of service receipts and grew by 9.9 percent to 5.96tri/-(2,593.3 million US dollars), owing to increase in the tourist arrivals. Service receipts accounted for 45.6 percent of total export of goods and services. The overall balance of payments was a deficit of 86.71bn/- (37.7 million US dollars) in the year ending September 2019 compared with a deficit of USD 276.4 million in year ending September 2018. Meanwhile the current account deficit widened to 4.88tri/- (2,122.7 million US dollars) from 4.23tri/- (1,841.4 million US dollars), owing to higher goods imports, particularly capital and intermediate goods which are used for production, coupled with a decline in official current transfers.
