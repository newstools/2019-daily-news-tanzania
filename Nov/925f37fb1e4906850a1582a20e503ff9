AT least 120 top golfers from across the country are set to battle for supremacy on Saturday, courtesy of Serengeti Premium Lager sponsored annual competition known as Waitara Golf Tournament. The one-day 2019 Waitara Golf Tournament is expected to kick off at the Lugalo Golf Course in Dar es Salaam. Announcing the sponsorship towards the event, Serengeti Breweries Limited Marketing Manager Anitha Msangi told reporters the brewer’s support to the tournament was aimed at promoting development of golf sport in the county. “SBL, through its flagship brand Serengeti Premium Lager, is proud to be the main sponsor of this year’s Waitara Golf Tournament. Our support to this tournament shows our solid commitment in supporting the developing of sports activities in the country,” Msangi said. The company also through Serengeti Premium Lager, is the main sponsor of Tanzania’s national soccer team, Taifa Stars, while the Lite variant of the brand popularly known as Serengeti Lite is the main sponsor of the national women premier league. On his part, the Lugalo Golf Club chairman Brigadier General (rtd) Michael Luwongo expressed his appreciation to SBL for the sponsorship and urged other companies and organisations to come forward and support golf development in the country. “We are very grateful for what SBL has been doing in supporting the development of golf as well as other sports in the country. We are particularly happy to note that the beer-maker has now become the biggest supporter of this tournament,” he said. The Waitara Golf Tournament is held every year with the objective to honour General (rtd) George Waitara’s contribution to the sports sector in Tanzania by initiating the golf course at the Lugalo Golf Club. The golf course started operating in 2006, following the immense contribution of General Waitara, while he was the chief of Tanzania’s defence forces. His contribution was also greatly enhanced and supported by his successor, General Davis Mwamunyange.
