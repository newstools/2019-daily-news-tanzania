PHARMACY Council of Tanzania (PCT) has proposed to the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to harmonise pharmaceutical industry professional standards to ease movement of labour in the bloc. PCT Registrar Elizabeth Shekalaghe gave the proposal in Dar es Salaam on Tuesday on the sidelines of the current meeting for SADC senior officials responsible for health and HIV/AIDS. “We need to share best practices among ourselves as professionals in the region and work in any SADC member state. This is being done in the East African Community (EAC),” Ms Shekalaghe told reporters. The meeting started in the city on Monday and is expected to end on Friday this week, with ministers for health and responsible for HIV/Aids meeting on Thursday to discuss and resolve on various matters to improve health services in the region. Being an institution responsible for maintaining professional standards for the pharmacists in the country, the council said its pharmacists are all over the country to provide the services. Speaking over contribution of the council towards fighting HIV/Aids, Ms Shekalaghe explained that they usually work to ensure that the Antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) are not sold by private pharmacies. “These drugs are given for free by the government from the public hospitals. If there are private dealers selling them, it is against the law,” she warned. On malaria, one of the meeting agenda items, the registrar said the council will always emphasise on proper use of drugs, based on physicians’ prescriptions. The council participates to the SADC senior officials meeting to learn challenges that other SADC member states face in their respective pharmaceutical industries and use the challenges as opportunities. She further underscored the need for training, describing it as critical in building capacity among the pharmaceutical professionals in the region.
