COUNTRYWIDE rural electrification has reached 66 per cent, Rural Energy Agency (REA) Acting Director General, Mr Amos Maganga said yesterday. He gave the statistics when speaking to reporters on the upcoming survey on the productivity brought by the energy and rural electrification project to be carried out by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Mr Maganga said out of the 12,268 villages countrywide as of October this year, 8,000 villages have been reached during the rural electrification projects. The government, he said, since 2008 has dished 2.3tr/- for the rural electrification projects, saying the remaining villages will be covered by 2020/21 financial year. Mr Maganga said after meeting the target, the agency in collaboration with the Ministry of Energy and NBS have decided to conduct a survey to know how best the facility has improved socio-economic welfare of the communities. Speaking on behalf of the Statistician General, NBS Manager of Agriculture Statistics, Mr Titus Mwisomba said they have started carrying out the survey which will cover all 26-Mainland regions. He said the survey will cover a sample of 12,600 households so that they can come up with statistics which will support the government in its planning and take proper decision with clear data. “We want to study if electrification has brought out the needed impact for improved social services as well as socio- economic development, and if there are loopholes which can be worked for better with the relevant authorities” he said. He said they are done with preparation of questionnaires for the households as well as village leaders, which are being worked out since early this week in collaboration with authorities in Regional Administration and Local Government. The process to fill in the questionnaires which started on Monday this week is expected to last for one month, whereas the findings will be released early January.
