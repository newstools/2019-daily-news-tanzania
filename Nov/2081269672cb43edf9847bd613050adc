Former Arsenal boss and one of the longest serving EPL managers, Arsene Wenger is returning to football after he agreed to become Fifa's new chief of global football development, BBC has reported. Before the new deal, there were speculations linking the 70-year-old Frenchman with a return to soccer as Bayern Munich manager. Wenger left the Gunners in May 2018, after 22 years in charge, three Premier League titles and seven FA Cups. "I very much look forward to taking on this extremely important challenge," he was quoted by BBCSport. According to the broadcasting corporation, Wenger's new role at the world governing body will help to develop men's and women's football, as well as technical aspects of the sport. “He will now be a member of the technical panel of the International Football Association Board, and chairman of Fifa's technical study group,” the BBC Sport report added.
