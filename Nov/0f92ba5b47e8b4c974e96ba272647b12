MINISTER for Agriculture, Japhet Hasunga has urged retired army officers to use their expertise to transform the agricultural sector by investing in it. Speaking during the opening of a two-day meeting between the government and retired army officers to engage in agriculture for improved economy yesterday, Mr Hasunga said: “Most of you retire at the age of 45 depending on one’s rank and not the statutory retirement age of 60 years of public servants. It is at an age where you still have a lot of energy and expertise which we want you to utilise in agricultural investment projects.” He said the government had decided to organise the meeting to see how best to engage the retired army officers in agriculture in areas of inputs, marketing, commercial farming, increased productivity and value addition. “Pick your areas of interest and go for them. Most of you have been doing a good job as far as agriculture is concerned when in service. So, use such experience and expertise for increased productivity and improve your livelihoods,” he advised. The minister outlined some of the areas which the government needed their involvement as commercial farming which would ultimately have a positive impact on industries, employment and the national economy at large. Other areas the minister said they could explore included pesticides, fertilisers and seeds which still needed a lot of investment. “You can choose to have seedlings nurseries which are of high demand and have the best for increased productivity. The current demand per year is 120,000 tonnes while local production and imports as of last year were 57,000 tonnes,” said the minister. However, he cautioned that for the best results, they must be diligent and since they had been doing it during their active army service, they would make it provided they kept adhering to good agricultural practices.
