DODOMA District Commissioner (DC) Patrobas Katambi has warned people who are invading areas at Kitelela to create an impression that they are residents in an attempt to be paid compensation to pave the way for Msalato Airport. He said the government would take appropriate legal action against such individuals. The DC issued a warning while addressing residents of Kitelela at a meeting held at Miyuji Ward in Dodoma, at which he received a progress report on preparations for payment of compensations for deserving individuals. Mr Katambi said that a verification exercise for payment of compensation would start beginning this week, stressing that the government was determined to block individuals who sought to benefit from the exercise illegally. “If there are people who think that they will get taxpayers’ money to which they are not entitled, I am asking them to shelve the idea peacefully, and those who remain defiant may land in jail,” he remarked. On the ongoing verification and assessment, Mr Katambi said the exercise stems from the fact that residents have been waiting for their compensation since 2011 when they were asked to suspend all activities in the area to pave the way for construction of Msalato International Airport. According to the DC, the ongoing verification would cover 1,053 residents.
