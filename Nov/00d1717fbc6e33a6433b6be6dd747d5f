DISCUSSIONS are ongoing between the United Republic of Tanzania and the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar to harmonize existing laws and computation of taxes to enable residents to cruise motor vehicles registered in both parts of the union without hassles. Currently, motor vehicles registered by the Zanzibar Revenue Board (ZRB) are required to obtain a special permit before being allowed in Tanzania Mainland, thus inconveniencing residents from the islands who wish to use their vehicles in the mainland. Responding to a basic question by Shaurimoyo MP, Mr Mattar Ali Salum (CCM), the Deputy Minister for Finance and Planning, Dr Ashatu Kijaji, said the harmonization of the laws and taxes will follow all required procedures set by the National Assembly and Zanzibarâ€™s House of Representatives. The MP had complained why vehicles registered by the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) in the Mainland were allowed to cruise freely in Zanzibar and yet those registered by ZRB in the islands were required to first obtain a permit before being allowed on the roads on the mainland. Mr Salum claimed further that the procedure to obtain a permit in the mainland is very cumbersome for motor vehicles registered in Zanzibar compared to those from neighbouring Kenya and Uganda. In response to the question, the deputy minister elaborated that the laws governing registration of motor vehicles in the mainland and Zanzibar were different and did not fall under issues of the union. In view of those factors, the governments of the two parts were currently working to harmonize laws and computation of taxes for motor vehicles to enable residents from Zanzibar to drive their cars in the mainland without obtaining permits. The deputy minister explained further that registration in Tanzania is undertaken by TRA through the Road Safety Act of 1973 and its regulations while in Zanzibar it is done by ZRB under the Road Transport Act Number 7 of 2003.
