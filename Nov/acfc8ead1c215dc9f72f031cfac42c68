HUMAN rights activists advocating the rights of marginalised groups specifically children, women and people with disabilities (PWDs) have appealed to the government to double budget allocation to the judiciary. Several nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) met to discuss how best the government could increase budget to the judiciary so that gender-based violence (GBV) cases could be expedited to reduce court backlog. They were speaking recently during a two-day roundtable discussion to influence resources allocation to enhance the capacity of the justice system for marginalised groups. The roundtable discussion was organised and coordinated by the Legal and Human Rights Centre (LHRC). Addressing journalists on the sidelines of the meeting, Ms Renatha Selemani from LHRC’s Desk for Women and Children said: “We have had hurdles in financial resources in dealing with issues facing children and women which impedes the dispensation of justice.” She added that LHRC was committed to improving the justice system in the country so that GBV cases could be filed in court and that is why LHRC organized and coordinated the roundtable discussion with NGOs, community development officers and government officials from Bariadi and Tarime. “We want the government to have adequate budget which can facilitate the establishment of gender desks at ward level countrywide,’’ she added. Speaking at a similar event, Save the Children child rights and governance specialist Neema Bwaira said the lobbies were trying to look into ways which the government could increase the budget for all bodies dealing with GBV, including the judiciary, the prisons and the police, among others. “We want to see technological improvement in courts, enough judges, magistrates and police stations in the country to investigate GBV cases countrywide,” she said.
