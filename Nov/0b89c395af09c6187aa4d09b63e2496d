TANZANIAN eligible voters are today going to the polling stations to cast their ballots in the civic polls to elect local government leaders who will lead them in the next five years. The election is, by all standards, regarded as crucial given the fact that leaders elected are the ones who live together with the public at grassroots level. Given this fact, eligible voters are duty bound to choose good leaders who are reputable in our societyleaders who will diligently serve the public, cognizant of the fifth phase government’s resolve to find solutions to problems afflicting the ordinary people. In these civic polls, eligible voters will today exercise their democratic right by electing leaders of hamlets, villages and Mtaa (Street) in urban areas. Under local government setting, these leaders play an important role as they serve as the link between the residents of the given area ( Kitongoji, Village, or Street) and the upper administrative establishments. Local governments ensure effective and equitable delivery of qualitative and quantitative services to the people within their areas of jurisdiction. Experts in local governments state that the importance of civic polls should never be underestimated in nation building since local leaders are designed to mobilise citizen participation in local development. In addition to the basic functions, all local governments are charged with formulation, coordination and supervision of the implementation of all plans for economic, industrial and social development in their areas of jurisdiction. The stage is already for today’s civic polls with President John Magufuli and Minister of State in the President’s Office (Regional Administration and Local Governments) Selemani Jaffo urging eligible voters to turn up in large numbers to the polling stations to exercise their democratic right. Inspector General of Police (IGP) Simon Sirro has assured the public of security before, during and after the polls.
