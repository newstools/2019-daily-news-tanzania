THE Tanzanian embassy Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, may be in trouble in the wake of reports that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation has handed over a file on it to the Prevention and Combatting Bureau( PCCB) to investigate claims of financial fraud. According to reports availed to press by the Ministry’s Communication Department, the file for investigation was handed over to the anti-corruption body in Dar es Salaam on Friday. Permanent Secretary for the Ministry, Dr Faraji Mnyepe, who handed over the file to the PCCB’s Deputy Director General Brig Gen John Mbungo, said the government decision to assign the task to the anticorruption watchdog follows reports of loss of an undisclosed amount of money at the embassy. However, Dr Mnyepe could not divulge further information on the reports of loss of funds at the embassy nor did he state how the loss occurred, confining himself to pointing out that the amount lost could only be determined upon completion of the investigation. The decision to investigate the loss is in implementation of the fifth phase government’s resolve to fight corruption as well as curbing improper expenditure of taxpayers’ money. This is the first time during President John Magufuli’s administration that a Tanzanian embassy is placed under investigation following reports of financial loss.
