COMPLAINTS related to childrenâ€™s neglect filed at local government authorities increased by 10 per cent during 2018/2019, according to figures by the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children. Figures show that 11,897 cases were recorded during 2018/2019 compared to 11,815 filed in 2017/2018. Deputy Minister in the ministry, Dr Faustine Ndugulile, made the disclosure when responding to a basic question by Special Seats MP Ms Faida Mohamed Bakari (CCM). The MP had tasked the government to protect children of divorced women and widows, stating that most of such children were not catered for by their fathers. In response, Dr Ndugulile said the increased complaints were due to increased awareness among neglected mothers on reporting such cases to social welfare officers to local government authorities. The Children Act No. 21 of 2009 requires social welfare officers to assist neglected mothers to acquire their rights, including provision of child support. It requires parents and guardians to provide requisite care to children. Section 14 of the legislation provides for penalties for parents or guardians who breach the law, including a fine of not less than 5m/- or a jail term of six months or both. Dr Ndugulile called upon all neglected mothers to consult social welfare officers in their respective areas so that appropriate measures can be taken against negligent fathers.
