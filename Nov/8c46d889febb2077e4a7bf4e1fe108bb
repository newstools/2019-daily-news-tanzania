IF everything goes as planned, Tanzania will soon start exporting purified gold as part of efforts to ensure the key sub-sector yields positive results. The timely development, which also gears on improving general performance of the sector, was unveiled in the country’s capital by Deputy Minister for minerals Stanslaus Nyongo at the Tanzania Extractive Industry conference organised here by HakiRasilimali recently. HakiRasilimali is a local Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), and the conference, held in line with the Civil Society Organisations (CSOs)’s Week 2019, which climaxed last week, aimed at giving a crucial platform for stakeholders in the mineral sector to deliberate on diverse relevant key issues. According to Mr Nyongo, purified gold will have at least 95per cent of the world purity standards. He added that the envisaged process aims at additional value to locally produced gold before export, due to the fact that purified gold is marketed at higher prices in the global market. “The fifth phase government has decided to start exporting purified gold after the country successfully managed to install gold refineries, including the major one in Dodoma,” he pointed out. Over 15 CSOs led by Foundation for Civil Society (FCS) convened here last week with a view to bringing together key members and their respective organisations to effectively engage in in-depth discussions on their work and explore how best stakeholders can collaborate with the government in finding solutions to problems besetting the people.
