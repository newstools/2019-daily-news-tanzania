EXPERTS in marine environment have embarked on a project aimed at restoring and protecting seagrasses as efforts to mitigate the impact of climate change in coastal areas. Seagrasses, underwater plants that evolved from land plants, are crucial in preventing beach erosion, increase biodiversity and provide breeding ground for marine species. Speaking at the launch of the three -year project (2019-2021) dubbed ‘Ecosystem-Based Protection of the Coastline: Effectiveness of Seagrasses’ held in Dar es Salaam over the weekend, Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute (TAFIRI) Dar es Salam Centre Director, Dr Simon Kangwe said besides its benefits, coastal areas are at risk due to environmental pollution resulting from human activities. “This situation threatens the living organisms and can have an impact on the economy and the health of the people living in coastal areas, for example, increase in soil nutrients due to excessive use of fertilizers and industrial waste,” he said. Dr Kangwe further said that most coastlines were facing a challenge of rising in temperature due to climate change, which has led to the rise in sea level, beach erosion and floods. He said that various efforts were undertaken to overcome beach erosion, such as construction of seawalls, but they were not very effective, thus forcing experts to come up with other alternatives to fight erosion in beaches through ecological systems such as mangrove trees, coral reefs and seagrasses. “Besides mangrove trees and coral reefs which are common to the people, seagrasses are not well known to the public despite being effective in preventing beach erosion, increase biodiversity and marine related activities such as fishing and tourism,” Dr Kangwe said. He observed that the project has come at the right time as countries around the world were using green infrastructure to protect beaches as an important step in combating coastal erosion, increase biodiversity and overcome the effects of climate change. For her part, Head of Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Technology Department at the University of Dar es Salaam, Dr Blandina Lugendo, said that the project funded by Western Indian Ocean Marine Sciences Association (WIOMSA) aimed at restoring and protecting seagrasses due to its importance in increasing biodiversity and prevention of beach erosion.
