AIR Tanzania Company Limited (ATCL) has highlighted strategies for meeting the expectations of its booming domestic and international customers after recording successes beyond its expectations. The strategies, which include increasing the number of flights per day during the upcoming end-of-year festive seasons described to be a peak period, depend on the recently purchased air crafts and reviving the ones undergoing repairs. The company’s Managing Director, Eng Ladislaus Matindi, said in Dar es Salaam over the weekend that market shares had doubled above previous projections and would grow further during the forthcoming festive season. “We are implementing the five-year strategic plan which will end in 2022; currently, ATCL dominates 73 per cent of the domestic market against 40 per cent which was projected when we were developing the current strategic plan. We are grateful for this trust from our customers and are doing everything possible to meet their flying requirements,” he stated. Eng Matindi further revealed that the plans include increasing the number of flights as more people will be moving from place to place with their loved ones during the holidays and more tourists were expected to come over during the period. The ATCL boss said one more purchased aircraft was due for delivery later this month and two 50-passenger Fokker F50 aircrafts would be serviced, raising the company’s fleet to 14 by the year 2022. On the market share distribution, he said the Dar es salaam - Mwanza route had the lion’s share with its Airbus A220, whose capacity is more than 140 passengers and makes three flights per day, and yet the demand was yet to be met. The Kilimanjaro, Dodoma and Songwe routes were next on the market demand scenario, and the newly established Dar-es-Salaam - Katavi route was performing well, which will prompt ATCL to add a number of flights from one to at least two a week in the near future, the MD explained
