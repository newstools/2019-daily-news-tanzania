The government on Wednesday signed a deal with Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS).

JCIA has been working with the Revenue Authorities of EAC countries, including Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) focusing on enhancing the performance of services provided to customers in the regions to achieve an efficient and smooth border operations since 2017. In Tanzania JICA was able to construct One Stop Border (OSBP) at the Rusumo border located between Tanzania and Rwanda, and Namanga border located between Tanzania and Kenya whose operation started in 2016 and 2018 respectively. The introduction and enhancement of OSBP was remarkable and effective making a dramatic reduction of border crossing-time reduction from 8hours and 42minutes to 2hours 20minutes equivalent to more than 70 percent of the previous condition. The installation will contribute on building a stable and reliable institution to promote a regional economic development that would facilitate trading activities and ensure border control of all five countries including Tanzania.
