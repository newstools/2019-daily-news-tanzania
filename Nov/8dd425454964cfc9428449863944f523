MINISTER of State in the Vice-President Office (Environment and Union Affairs), George Simbachawene has stressed a need for members of the public to heed expert advice to reduce environmental degradation which contributes to climate change. He said this on Thursday when officiating at an annual learning and sharing experience event (ALE) 2019 organised by agricultural non-state actors forum (ANSAF). The minister said climate change had continued being a national and global disaster which mostly affected the agricultural sector in the country. The meeting, which attracted more than 100 delegates from state and non-state actors, was organised under the theme “the alarming danger and opportunities of climate change to the agricultural sector”. Mr Simbachawene insisted the need to impart knowledge to members of the public and stakeholders so that they refrained from acts that contributed to climate change. “Environmental degradation is aggravated by ignorance of how to mitigate the effects of climate change. Human activities are among the factors that lead to climate change. We should use a climate smart approach to mitigate climate change,” the minister noted. Mr Simbachawene mentioned some human factors that caused climate change as deforestation and overgrazing. For his part, ANSAF Executive Director, Audax Rukonge said the aim of the annual learning was to share and learn from smallholder producers and other stakeholders on how to control activities that contributed to climate change effects in the country. “The aim of ALE is to showcase and highlight the alarming danger and opportunities of climate change especially in the agricultural sector. We expect to come up with recommendations on how to mitigate the effects of climate change. The private sector has a big role in achieving the climate change agenda,” he said.
