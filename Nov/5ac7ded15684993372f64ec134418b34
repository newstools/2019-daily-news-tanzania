CONSTRUCTION works on the eagerly awaited Serengeti airport on the outskirts of Mugumu town have begun, according to Serengeti District Executive Director (DED), Engineer Juma Hamsini. The district council, Engineer Hamsini said, expects to spend about 450m/-on construction of the airport passenger building. “As the council, we have started with construction of the modern passenger building that can accommodate tourists from any part of the world,” DED Hamisni told the ‘Daily News’. Construction of the airport is expected to raise the council’s internal revenues from the current 3.5 to 10bn/-, he said. “It will also help to increase the value of land and improve incomes of Serengeti residents in many ways,” he said. Serengeti councilors prefer the airport to be called Serengeti instead of Mugumu airport. More importantly, construction of the airport, Engineer Hamsini said will help to reduce human activities at the busiest airports—Seronera and Kogatende—within the world famous Serengeti National Park. “The major objective is to conserve Serengeti ecology and enhance security of the Serengeti Park,” Engineer Hamisni said. If all goes well, the airport construction is scheduled to end in 2021. Serengeti residents have always been calling for construction of the airport, hoping that it will help to speed up economic development in Tanzania’s wildlife rich district in Mara region. Large part of the district is made up of wildlife conservation areas. The airport construction therefore is also expected to enable local residents who have lived with wild animals for years to reap wildlife conservation fruits through tourism related activities.
