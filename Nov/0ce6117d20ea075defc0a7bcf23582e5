ZANZIBAR Second Vice-President Seif Ali Iddi has officially opened a four-day regional meeting of the World Food Organisation (WFP), saying that many people in Africa still face malnutrition and hunger. He has said that Africa needs to address disasters, conflicts, insecurity, drought and climate as challenges that need to be tackled to end malnutrition and hunger. “It is obvious that we have challenges that undermine people’s efforts to produce enough food. Let’s have workable strategies to minimize the problems,” he told WFP representatives from Southern and northern African and the Middle East countries who gathered at the Sea-Cliff Hotel in Unguja west District. A WFP report of 2018/2019 has also proved a decline in food production which has led to malnutrition among children in the country, while more than 220 million people in Africa face food shortages. Mr Iddi said good relations between Tanzania and WFP have helped the country to have fewer problems facing its people and refugees compared to other countries in the region. “Trainings for better farming, nutrition, and other support to small farmers have helped our country to be a safe place for all,” he explained. WFP Country Representative, Mr Michael Dunford, said plans were underway to implement three programmes in Zanzibar to strengthen relations with the UN agency.
