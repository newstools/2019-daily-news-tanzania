KILIMANJARO Queens Head Coach, Bakari Shime has urged Tanzanians to come in big number and be part of history as they target to clinch CECAFA Women Championship three times in a row. The Queens begin their title defence today at Azam Complex in Dar es Salaam as they entertain South Sudan in their opening match of the eight team tournament. The best two teams in each group will jump into the semifinals and later, the other top two teams will consequently make it to the finals to decide which side will be crowned this year’s title. Speaking on Friday, Shime said having triumphed in foreign territories for the past two years; it is now time to do the same from the home turf. “It was hard to win the silverware in Uganda and Rwanda respectively because we lacked our supporters but now, the contest has been brought here and a good opportunity for us to claim it in front of our fans,” Shime said. He then expressed his satisfaction with the way his charges have been responding to training sessions, insisting that doing well in all their matches will be number one priority. “The most important thing is to keep us in prayers so that we wake up with good health tomorrow (today) and let the job be done,” he said. On her part, the team’s central defender Fatuma Issa said basing on the level of preparation they have had, there is no way they are going to impress during the competition. “We have received good training from our coaches and morale in the squad is great. For us, we are just ready for the competition even though it will not be that easy,” she said. Asked which team she thinks might cause them trouble, the defender said they will respect all their opponents but will not fear them. “Some of the teams are new such that we have not met them before while others are regular hence everything will be seen from the field,” she said.
