MOZAMBIQUE will square off with Rwanda in their opening 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualification Group F match at the Estádio do Zimpeto in Maputo today. The Black Mambas are looking to qualify for the finals for the fifth time after missing out in the 2019 tournament in Egypt. Portugal-based defender Zainadine Júnior and Bidvest Wits winger Elias Pelembe are two influential players in the Black Mambas squad. Luis Filipe Gonçalves, the Mozambique coach, says his team needs to learn how to start strongly having faced Kenya in a friendly match last month. “To remain competitive we have to avoid low starts in the game as seen in the first half,” Gonçalves told Goal. “We have to start better next time, it is something we are going to work on.” Meanwhile, Rwanda are hoping to start their qualifying campaign with a victory having made their only appearance in the finals at the 2004 tournament in Tunisia. All eyes will be on the Waps’ deadly strikers Jacques Tuyisenge and Meddie Kagere, who have made their names in CAF club tournaments. Vincent Mashami, the Rwanda coach, says his side has a good momentum heading into their clash with Mozambique. “We have a positive team spirit and are focused on securing a good result against Mozambique,” Mashami told The New Times. “It will not be easy but the team has picked up the rhythm and I hope we will maintain the strong momentum we have had in this qualification round.” According to the Fifa website, Mozambique and Rwanda have met twice with the two teams recording one win each.
