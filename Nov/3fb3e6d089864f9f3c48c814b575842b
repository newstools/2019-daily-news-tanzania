THE United Arab Emirates (UAE) is willing to support Benjamin Mkapa Hospital (BMH) to enhance the scope of provision of health services in the country. Speaking on Thursday, the UAE Ambassador Khalifa Abdulrahman Mohamed Al-Marzooqi, said the country would support the Dodoma-based hospital in the upcoming budget of the Arabian Peninsula nation to enhance health services. “We are willing to support the hospital to enhance its health services. We are ready to hear from the hospital’s management where it needs support,” said the envoy shortly after visiting the hospital. Mr Marzooqi commended the government for the heavy investment manifested by establishment of Benjamin Mkapa Hospital, noting that it was one of the country’s state-of-the art health facilities. Acting Executive Director of the Benjamin Mkapa Hospital, Dr Kessy Shija, pointed out that establishment of the hospital was in response to the government’s ambition to have an ultramodern hospital. The 400-bed hospital became a second hospital in the country after Muhimbili National Hospital to conduct kidney transplant, enabling the government to save millions of shillings which would be spent on referring patients to medical facilities abroad. So far, seven people have undergone kidney transplant at Benjamin Mkapa Hospital since it introduced the medical service.
