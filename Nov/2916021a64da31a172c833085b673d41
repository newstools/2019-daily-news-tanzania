THE government has advised engineers in the country to be creative and observe professional ethics because the attainment of the middle-income economy depends on them. Deputy Minister for Works and Transport Atashasta Nditiye said this in Dar es Salaam on Thursday during the opening of an engineers’ capacity development forum (ECDF) organised by the Engineers Registration Board (ERB). “Engineers are the country’s pillar for the envisaged middle-income economy. That is why the government is making efforts to increase your number and ensure you are competent to supervise primary infrastructure countrywide.” He said it was a shame and sabotage for trusted engineers to carry out substandard works. “You have to maintain standards, including having right academic qualifications and being registered and recognised by ERB and relevant authorities,” he said. The deputy minister was surprised to learn that only 6,008 engineers were registered by ERB while it was evident that Tanzania had 27,000 qualified engineers. For his part, Sales and Marketing Manager of Dar es Salaam-based Lake Cement Limited, which produces Nyati Cement, Mr Michael Prosper, said his company had resorted to sponsor ECDF Engineers’ Day for it considered local engineers as facilitators of trade and industrial growth. “Nyati Cement, like any other producer, is not only dependent on engineers to consider production, but even shipping it to customers’ destinations.” Mr Prosper said other engineering works included refurbishing the mega gauge railway line (MGR) and the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) depend on engineers’ works and simplifies shipment of cement to neighbouring countries.
