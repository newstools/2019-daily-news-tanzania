EXIM Bank Tanzania has officially opened its newest branch in Dar es Salaam’s Mkwepu Street following the bank’s successful acquisition of UBL Bank, subsidiary of Pakistan’s UBL Bank, in its plan to spread and expand nationwide. This makes Exim Bank the first private sector bank to embark in the consolidation of banking sector in the country. Post-acquisition Exim Bank becomes one of the top5 banks in the country with an asset base of 1.7trl/-. “We are delighted by the diverse base of customers that will be joining Exim bank family and we assure the customers that we are thrilled to have you on board, and we commit to ensure that you continue to enjoy innovative solutions from us,’’ said Mr Jaffari Matundu, Exim Bank’s Chief Executive Officer. He added: “Tanzania has more banks compared to other larger economies viz. South Africa and Nigeria. The banking industry has been witnessing consolidation which will gradually leave well-capitalized players that will be able to catalyze economic growth. The consolidation also improves resilience to capital shocks and lowers compliance and technology costs.’’ The new expansion will increase the presence of Exim Bank to total of 33 branches across the country.
