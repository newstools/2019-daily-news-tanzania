EIGHTEEN specialist doctors from Germany Institute of Inter Plant Germany and Germany Committee against Blindness are in Rukwa Region to treat patients. An estimated 480 patients from neighbouring Zambia, Malawi and Kenya have registered for treatment. The team’s leader, Dr Marcus Strotkoetter, thanked the government for allowing them to enter the country, saying the major challenge they are facing is the large number of patients who have been registered for treatment. The specialist doctors have been providing free medical services twice a year in March and November since 2010 at Dr Atman designated health facility at Christ the King area in Sumbawanga municipality. Dr Atman health facility is run by the Roman Catholic Church, Sumbawanga Diocese, in collaboration with the government. According to Dr Strotkoetter, most of the patients who have registered for treatment come from Rukwa, Katavi Songwe, Mbeya, Njombe and Iringa regions. “We have been providing free medical services to more than 4,000 patients since 2010,” he said. Dr Atman Hospital’s Administrator, Sr. Hyasinta Rubagaji, called upon different stakeholders donate food, water and transport fares to patients who are from poor families.
