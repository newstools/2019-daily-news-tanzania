TAIFA Stars captain, Mbwana Samatta has become a wanted man after scoring for KRC Genk a goal during their UEFA Champions League 2-1 loss to Liverpool at Anfield on Tuesday night. Newcastle and West Ham from Britain announced their interest in signing the Genk striker, Samatta. The 26-year-old, who scored against Liverpool in his side’s 2-1 Champions League defeat on Tuesday, has a release clause in his contract reported to be about £10m. Samatta was the top scorer in the Belgian league last season with 25 goals as Genk were crowned champions. The Tanzanian has six goals from 13 league games this season. Samatta headed Genk level before the interval, but it was not enough to inspire his Belgian side to victory in a Uefa Champions League clash at Anfield, England. He cancelled out Georginio Wijnaldum’s opener with his 40th-minute header off Bryan Heynen’s corner-kick in the Group E match. “I am extremely elated to score a goal at Anfield, where there is always a great atmosphere,” Samatta said. “This is like a dream come true,” Samatta–the national soccer team, Taifa Stars, captain– added. It took a 53rd minute strike by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to down Genk 2-1 in the thrilling match. The defeat left Genk rooted to the bottom of the group a n d d a s h e d their hopes of qualifying for the next round. They have one point after four matches, but Samatta assured they will end their group campaign on a high with fixtures against RB Salzburg and Napoli coming up next. “I don’t think we’re ever happy to lose. We did well but we’re disappointed to end up on the losing side,” he said. He added: “We have two big games coming up and we’ll try and do our best to finish the group well."
