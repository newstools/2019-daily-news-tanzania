ZANTEL Tanzania has said the introduction of cost effective smartphone ‘smarta’ in the local market is key driver in bringing about digital transformation and ultimately push up financial inclusion. The increased use of smartphones in the country will not only enhance internet penetration but also promotes digital transformation revolving around innovation and use of technology that will fundamentally transform businesses. Zantel’s Head of Mobile Business, Aneth Muga said in Dar es Salaam over the weekend that, “We have introduced Smarta in the market to propel affordable access to smartphones while giving people a unique opportunity to enjoy the opportunities presented by the digital lifestyle offered by Zantel through 4G network.” She said adding that Zantel’s 4G network technology make it one of the fastest internet speed in the East African region. She said the increased use of smartphones will boost digital inclusion in the country by serving the previously underserved population. Zantel effectively contributes in accelerating digital access and therefore, spurring the development of the local telecom industry’s entire digital ecosystem. The Head of Zantel Zanzibar, Mohammed Mussa said the telecom company seeks to foster digital development by facilitating availability of affordable technology across the country. “The availability of Smarta, the Smart feature phone comes with huge benefits to the people, more so in boosting digital literacy and development of digital technology in Zanzibar and the whole country,” he noted. Conversely, smarta is also set to increase the ownership of smartphones among Zantel customers who use Ezypesa, Zantel’s mobile financial service, thus further driving the financial inclusion drive. According to Pew Research Centre (2018), Tanzania is one of the fastest smartphone penetrating markets in the Sub- Saharan Africa, which is likely to be supported by the Zantel’s introduction of affordable mobile phones in the region.
