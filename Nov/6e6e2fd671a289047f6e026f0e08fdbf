HIMITI villagers in Bonga Ward have pleaded with the Manyara Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr Alexander Mnyeti to support them to complete construction of their Dispensary that is becoming expensive to fund with their own resources. The residents said that they have been responding well with their own contributions in line with the government’s plan, but the going is becoming too tough. One of the villagers, Ms Salima Mohammed, told the RC who was touring their village that they started constructing the Dispensary in 2009, but up to now, they have failed to complete it. “Other villages have completed theirs in line with the government plan that every village should have a dispensary to limit walking long distances for the same service elsewhere. “Ours is a menace, because the building has since remained as if we are starting today. We deliver while in Bajaj going to other villagers’ Dispensaries. This is a great problem…we already have water, but lack a dispensary and electricity,” said Ms Mohammed. In response, Mr Mnyeti promised them that the Dispensary would be completed before the end of the year.
