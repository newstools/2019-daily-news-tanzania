THE leadership of China-Africa Business Council in Tanzania (CABCT) says the ongoing governmentâ€™s efforts in improving teaching environments in schools would bear positive impacts in the envisaged industrial economy by 2025. "For the economy to grow, it needs, skilled and innovative people. For an industrial economy, therefore, it needs creative people with various technical skills acquired through education," Chairman of the CABCT, Mr Xian Ding, said. Mr Ding, who doubles as director of Huatan Investment Group, made the remarks at the 55th graduation ceremony of Muhoro Primary school in Rufiji District, Coast Region. The Huatan Investment Group has established several investments in the manufacturing sector in Coast Region, including animal food processing factory at Pugu and automotive battery recycling industry. He said it was very crucial for students from primary to university level to study hard for the country to achieve sustainable development. "The students should impart knowledge which would enable them to be creative and come up with big businesses, being employed or invent technologies for developing the country," he stated. He said the association would continue supporting the country's efforts in improving the quality of education. He counseled pupils at the school to focus on education because their parents invested in them. In implementing his company's corporate social responsibility policy, Mr Ding donated shoes and cash to standards three and four pupils of Muhoro Primary School who had good results in their exams in a bid to boost their morale. He also donated funds to Nyamwage Primary School.
