UKANGE villagers in Lupila Ward, Makete District, have urged the government to set up a special potato market that will help them improve their livelihoods. It was after the implementation of a 71m/- potato irrigation farming project in the area proved successful, but low price remained a big challenge. Potato irrigation farming is part of the 2.6bn/- government development projects implemented by Tanzania Social Action Fund (Tasaf) in Makete from 2015 to 2019. Ukange Village Community Management Committee (CMC) Chairperson Erasto Ndelwa said yesterday that the market would make the crop strategic, productive and beneficial to farmers. He said the Tasaf project was for 71 beneficiaries, but non-beneficiaries also copied the technology, as a result there was high potato production, which needed reliable markets to make farmers increase investment. “Irrigation farming makes potato production available all the time as it doesn’t depend on rain. We apply modern potato farming and we invest a lot in terms of energy and time, but still the price is still low. We almost work for loss because, for instance, we buy 10kg of potato seeds at 8,000/- and sell the same at 10,000/-,” he said. Mr Ndelwa stressed that, potatoes were in high demand in various parts of the country, particularly in towns and cities, but still farmers kept on benefiting traders due to the fact that the latter bought from them at a low price. Responding to the farmers’ plight, Administrative Secretary Fransic Namaumbo said the government was concerned for the availability of markets for whatever was produced in the district. He said 2.6bn/- government projects included the improvement of roads to facilitate the transportation of farm produce to markets. “On the availability of markets, we plan to introduce a cooperative union. We also look for the means to connect our farmers with the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (Sagcot),” he said.
