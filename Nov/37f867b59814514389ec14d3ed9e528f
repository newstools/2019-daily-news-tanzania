ACT Wazalendo, one of the opposition parties, has pulled out of the local government elections scheduled for this month, a day after the main opposition party--Chadema--made the same decision. According to a statement issued in Dar es Salaam by the party’s leader, who also doubles as Kigoma Urban MP, Zitto Kabwe, ACT Wazalendo withdrew from the civil polls, claiming the doors for democracy are shut. He said a total of 173,593 party members volunteered to collect nomination forms and filled in but very unfortunately authorities either refused to receive them or closed offices. “We don’t agree with the reasons given by the government and the ruling party. The party’s governing committee that held its meeting today decided that all other members whose forms were accepted should pull out of the race,” Kabwe said. On Thursday, Chadema party national chairman, Freeman Mbowe announced the withdrawal of his party from the forthcoming on grounds of massive disqualification of its candidate. But, the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi, through its Publicity and Ideology Secretary, Humphrey Polepole, said the disqualification resulted from ignorance of the law, rules and regulations that governed the civil poll procedures on the part of opposition candidates.
