CHADEMA National Chairman Freeman Mbowe yesterday threw the ball to the police, linking them with the killing of National Institute of Transport (NIT) student Akwilina Akwiline Baftaa. Presenting his defence evidence against the seditious charges he and eight other senior party officials are facing at the Kisutu Resident Magistrate’s Court, Mbowe accounted two factors, though he was not certain, allegedly implicating the police with the murder of the student. The first sign, he said, comes from the police themselves. He told Principal Resident Magistrate Thomas Simba that after the killing, Dar es Salaam Police Special Zone Commander Lazaro Mambosasa announced the arrest of several police officers suspected to have committed the offence. “The second sign relates to availability of some reports that there were other people who were shot by the police at the same area on the same day,” the opposition party leader led by his Advocate Peter Kibatala, told the court. It is alleged, among others, that on February 16, 2018 along Kawawa Road at Mkwajuni area, being assembled with intent to carry out a common purpose, jointly and together, all the accused persons conducted themselves in such a manner as to cause a fear of breach of peace. The prosecution claimed that on the same day and place, with more than 12 other persons not in court, having riotously assembled, in disobedience of proclamation given by a police officer, the accused persons failed to disperse and continued to take part in the riot. Thereby, according to the prosecution, the accused persons breached the peace and terrified the public, culminating in the death of National Institute of Transport (NIT) Student, Akwilina Akwiline Baftaa, and injury of two police officers, Police Constable Fikiri and Corporal Rahim Msangi. Refuting the charges he is facing, Mbowe explained that to his knowledge, none of the party officials facing the trial were arrested by the police at Mkwajuni grounds where the shooting of the student took place, because all of them were apprehended after surrendering to the police on their own will in response to a call made by the police.
