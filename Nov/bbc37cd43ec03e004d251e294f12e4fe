HIGHER Education Students Loan Board (HESLB) has released 349.93bn/- to 108,238 university students for the 2019/2020 academic year, it was announced yesterday. HESLB Executive Director Abdul-Razaq Badru told reporters in Dar es Salam on Wednesday that 46,838 fresh university students have qualified for loans amounting to 162.86bn/- while 187.7bn/- is for 60,400 out of 82,285 continuing students. Mr Badru said the government has in this fiscal year allocated 450bn/-, with 164.6bn/- and 285.4bn/- for fresh entrants and continuing students, respectively, in higher learning institutions, assuring that the board has adequate funds. He added that the board plans to open a two-week application window effective this Sunday, urging applicants to prepare the entire prerequisite documents to fully support their applications. The board is still appraising applications from the needy and eligible applicants, Mr Badru said, adding: “We expect to release the next batch of students who will qualify for loans before the end of this month, with 1.7bn/- given out.” The CEO asked universities to submit examination results of continuing students before the 2019/20 academic year starts to avoid likely inconveniences to the loan beneficiaries. According to Mr Badru, the needy fresh students should fill online forms and attach important documents to correct errors. “What are required from applicants are written proof and documents indicating that they are from poor families, among others,” he explained. He said the board collected 183bn/- in loan repayment in the 2018/2019 fiscal year, up from 21.16bn/- collected in 2014/2015. Mr Badru said the number of beneficiaries has as well increased from 100,936 in 2014/2015 to 128,285 in 2019/2020. He added that in the four years of President John Magufuli’s leadership, the government has increased the budget allocation from 341bn/- in 2014/2015 to the current 450bn/-. Mr Badru said the board was highly satisfied with the commendable job of President Magufuli since he assumed the country’s highest office. HESLB’s Director of Loan Allocation and Disbursement Dr Veronica Nyahende said all fresh students, with pending applications have shortcomings in their application forms and should follow the given directives to avoid further problems. “This group was given two weeks to correct the errors,” said Dr Nyahende, hinting that the number of erroneous applications has significantly dropped this year, thanks to public awareness campaign by the board to prospective beneficiaries. Some cases of wrong applications this year include students submitting academic certificates, which were not certified by responsible authorities and others not submitting all the required documents.
