PETTY traders as well as various entrepreneurs in Busega District, Simiyu Region recently hailed NMB bank for agreeing to assist them with loans after listening to their pleas as a community of people many financial instructions have been sidelining. That was said recently by the traders at Nyashimo Trading Centre, while converging at NMB Business Club, organized the entrepreneurs in consultation with the area District Commissioner’s office. During the forum, NMB bank Lake Zone Acting Manager, Amos Daniel said that the traders would be offered with friendly loans with no strict attachments and conditions in a scheme dubbed ‘Fanikiwa’ which loosely translates as ‘succeed’ in English He said the loan acquisition would not subject a trader to have his/her house and piece of land as a mortgage, adding: “You can only register your motorcycle, some household belonging and some small assets, which may suit and weigh with the loan you are in need of, and we hope to reach many Tanzanians with this.” Mr Daniel said that they reached the decision after realizing that the majority traders are the majority in business and a hence, a force to reckon with for the economy to grow. Commenting on the considerable and friendly loans, the traders nearing 300 mostly said the financial institution was in a way translating its slogan of a Tanzania bank that is being close to the community. “We are told that here at the Fanikiwa loan, a trader can be loaned minimum of 500,000/- to 5m/-, and this is an opportunity to us and we are surely welcoming it with a big embrace. “We have been told that the loan that targets petty traders as well as other local entrepreneurs, there is no mortgage of a house or piece of land, but you can pin your normal things like motorcycle, vehicle and other house belonging,” said Lamadi Urban resident, Josephat Goryo at the occasion. On her part, Anna Chilongani, who is a petty trader from Nyashimo promised to exploit the loan offer to improve her business instead of relying solely on subsistence farming that only feeds her family. “Several petty traders have been complaining of being sidelined by banks on loan offers, because the banks have raised interest rate charges and tough conditions, but now NMB bank has come to us with an option that would be our main focus,” she said.
