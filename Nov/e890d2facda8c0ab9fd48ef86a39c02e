MINISTER for Energy, Dr Merdard Kalemani, has directed the Petroleum Bulk Procurement Agency (PBPA) to ensure by December this year Mtwara Port starts importing and exporting on transit fuel. Moreover, launching the PBPA board yesterday he assigned it to increase Mtwara Port’s handling capacity of 38,000 tonnes of petroleum products, but the storage capacity was only 25,000 tonnes. “Make sure you increase Mtwara Port storage capacity from the current 26 million litres to 80 million litres for the supply of petroleum products to Mtwara, Lindi, Ruvuma and other neighbouring areas,” said Dr Kalemani. “For increased government revenue collection by December the port should start importing and exporting on transit petroleum products to neighbouring countries of Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia and an implementation report should be submitted to me.” He also instructed them to work closely with Energy and Water Regulatory Authority (Ewura) to deal with unfaithfull gas station owners who create a shortage while waiting for new indicative prices. “Stern measures should be taken against the culprits and those proved to play dirty games will have their stations shut down,” he insisted.
