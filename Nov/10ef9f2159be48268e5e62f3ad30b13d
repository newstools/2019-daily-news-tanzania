President John Magufuli has launched a book depicting the life-journey of former president Benjamin Mkapa who turned 81 today. Titled ‘My Life, My Purpose’, the book was launched at the Julius Nyerere International Convention Centre (JNICC) where former presidents Jakaya Kikwete and Ali Hassan Mwinyi respectively were in attendance. The launch ceremony also attracted Zanzibar President Ali Mohamed Shein, diplomats and academics of all calling. In the 319 –page book, the former president admitted that politics wasn’t his passion until when joined Pugu Secondary School in the late 1950s and later Makerere University College in Uganda. Mkapa disclosed that his father wanted him to become a priest, and if not possible, a doctor, or if the two options weren’t suitable he should be a teacher. Those three options weren’t suitable for Mkapa’s choice. Guest of honour at the book launch ceremony President John Magufuli praised his predecessor for writing the book detailing his life and encouraged retired leaders, but not limited to former presidents, to write books on their experiences to impart their knowledge to young Tanzanians and future generations. “I’m informed that Mzee Mwinyi book is in the final touches, Kikwete is still writing…I would further be happy to read Warioba and Speaker Ndugai’s books,” he said.
