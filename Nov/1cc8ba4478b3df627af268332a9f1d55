MORE emphasis in capacity building for enhancing primary health care provision is needed as a way for saving lives through early diagnosis and reducing cost for treatment, health experts assert. Researches have shown that half of the health problems can be solved and early diagnosis of diseases like cancer can be done by primary care practitioners, explained the Aga Khan Health Service, East Africa Regional Chief Executive Officer, Sulaiman Shahabuddin. during the French Health Care Day in Dar es Salaam yesterday. The event was attended by French and Tanzanian representatives from public and private sectors with the support of Sanofi and Biomerieux companies, where experts discussed on the fight against diseases, capacity building for health officials and the partnership needed to curb diseases. “Primary care is the first point of access for consultation. If you go to the primary health care centre and get proper treatment, then there is no need to go further. But, if need arises then the patient will have proper basic treatment,” he commented, adding: “An example of breast cancer screening is not expensive, and if we enable health care providers from the primary levels by building their capacity to conduct such screening, then early diagnosis can be made at an early stage and treated, saving time, cost and turmoil that generates from it.” Mr Shahabuddin also stressed the importance of having partnerships in health sectors, as it is no longer about what the public or private sector, supplies, manufacturers can do; with the burden of diseases all must come together.
