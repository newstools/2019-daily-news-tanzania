TANZANIA’S state broadcaster is working to rehabilitate its eight AM radio broadcasting stations that it says face many transmitter and technical hitches, thus limiting wider coverage. Minister for Information, Culture, Arts and Sports Dr Harrison Mwakyembe named the stations whose facilities are outdated as being in Dodoma, Arusha, Mwanza, Kigoma, Kagera, Songea, Nachingwea and Dar es Salaam. “These stations are now very old, and as such, transmitting signals on mid-wave radio frequencies is frequently interrupted,” he said when responding to a supplementary question from Suleimani Moshi Kakoso (Mbanda Rural–CCM). The minister said the government was working with the universal communication service access fund to revive the Tanzania Broadcasting Corporation (TBC) stations. He said already five stations, including one in Longido, had been refurbished. “Others are Mtwara station. We’re now working in Pemba and we will move to Kilwa and Kilombero,” he announced. Shortage of radio frequencies is not a new problem and MPs have been raising their voice, pressing the government to improve the communication service, especially for border communities who opt to subscribe to foreign services. In her principal question, Taska Mbogo (Special Seats- CCM) alleged that, as a public broadcaster, TBC had not been paying much attention to foreigners who might need English services to follow up daily updates in the country. She said the only existing English service—external service –had been suspended. “This certainly affects foreign nationals."
