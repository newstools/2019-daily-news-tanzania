INFORMATION, Culture, Arts and Sports Minister Dr Harrison Mwakyembe has directed departments from both parts of the union to spread the use of Kiswahili language worldwide. The minister gave the call here on Monday during a coordinated meeting between his ministry and his counterpart from Zanzibar to discuss several issues pertaining to information, culture and arts. Briefing journalists on the outcomes of the meeting, Dr Mwakyembe said it aimed at sharing experiences and widening cooperation between both sides of the union, adding that during the meeting, participants got an ample time to receive reports of Permanent Secretaries from the mainland and in the Isles. Dr Mwakyembe insisted that the demand for Kiswahili language in the world was higher, necessitating the importance of the governments from both sides of the union to market and spread the language, globally. In another development, the minister directed the Tanzania Broadcasting Corporation (TBC), and Zanzibar Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC), to collaborate in programmes that market the country’s tourism, arts and culture to attract more tourists to visit the country for historical tourism and eventually boost the county’s revenues. During the meeting, Dr Mwakyembe said both governments agreed in the preparation for the East African Cultural Festival scheduled for Dar es Salaam in September and that they directed all departments to work together in preparing budgets and helping the national football team when it goes for several international tournaments.
