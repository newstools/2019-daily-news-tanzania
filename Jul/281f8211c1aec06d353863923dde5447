THE High Court, sitting at the Kisutu Resident Magistrate’s Court in Dar es Salaam, yesterday found with a case to answer, one Godfrey Samwel, who is charged with murder, for allegedly killing his wife. Senior Resident Magistrate Pamela Mazengo, who is hearing the murder case under extended jurisdiction, ruled that the prosecution, through its six witnesses who testified during the trial, established a prima facie case, requiring the accused to give his defence. During the trial, the prosecution witnesses were led by State Attorney Erick Shija. The magistrate ordered the accused to start giving his deference testimony starting July 18, 2019. Among the witnesses are two children (names withheld), who are step sons of the accused person and a medical doctor from Muhimbili National Hospital, Dr Innocent Mosha, who closed the prosecution’s window of witnesses . It is alleged by the prosecution that on June 21, 2014 in Ulongoni A in Ilala District, Dar es Salaam, Godfrey killed with deliberate intention his wife Bahati Hussein. At the close of the prosecution’s case during a criminal trial, the accused may submit to the judge or magistrate that there is no case for him to answer. If the judge agrees, the matter is dismissed and the defendant is acquitted without having to present any evidence in their defence. Prima facie may be used as an adjective meaning sufficiency to establish a fact or raise a presumption unless disproved or rebutted. An example of this would be to use the term “prima facie evidence.” A prima facie case is the establishment of a legally required rebuttable presumption. A prima facie case is a cause of action or defence that is sufficiently established by a party’s evidence to justify a verdict in his or her favour, provided such evidence is not rebutted by the other party.
