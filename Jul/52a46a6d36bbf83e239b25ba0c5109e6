ABOUT 4,500 pupils from five primary schools are receiving road safety training offered by Puma Energy Tanzania Limited through its road safety programme to improve road traffic safety in Dodoma City. Speaking yesterday, Puma Energy Managing Director, Dominic Dhanah said the road safety programme in Dodoma was the continuation of the road safety campaign that Puma Energy Tanzania Ltd started in 2013. “So far, the programme has reached over 100,000 students in 6 regions and over 80 schools in Tanzania,” said the company boss. Mr Dhanah pointed out the regions that were benefitting from the programme included Dar es Salaam, Geita, Kilimanjaro, Ruvuma, Arusha and Dodoma. “This year’s campaign involves at least 25 primary schools in the country–f ive schools in Dodoma. Other schools are in Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar,” he noted. Statistics show that 1.35 million people die in road accidents across the world each year. Road traffic injuries are the leading killer of children and young adults aged 5-29 years. Mr Dhanna said Puma Energy Tanzania decided to come to Dodoma City this year because the region had recently experienced an increase in the number of people, vehicles and social activities due to the government’s decision to relocate the capital city to Dodoma. “This increase poses a risk to schoolchildren’s safety to and from schools, but also Dodoma is one of the regions with the prevalence of road accidents in the country,” he said. Mr Dhanna added “This is the reason Puma Energy Tanzania has taken up this cause to demonstrate its commitment to saving people’s lives especially the lives of primary school children who are mostly exposed to road risks when going and coming back from schools.
