AS Tanzania has started preparations to host the sixth round of the 2019 African Rally Championship in September, the world’s motorsports governing body (FIA) has warned drivers of possible drug test. Tanzania will stage the continental level rally on September 14 and 15, which will also serve as the fifth round of the Tanzania National Rally Championship calendar. Random doping test is the latest development ahead of the sixth round as it was recently confirmed this week that crews and officials will be subjected to random doping tests prior to and during the event basing on the FIA rules. “For the drivers, the rules will be followed to the letter according to the FIA rules. And it will be in and out of competition. “One will be picked from the crowd and chaperoned to doping centre where a doctor will first use alco-blow and if need demand more samples from officials,” said deputy clerk of the course George Mwangi through a press release. According to the FIA rules, any driver with irregular samples will be disqualified from the race as well as facing suspension from active sport. Safari rally has attracted over 50 crews from different countries and it will run for three days starting on 5-7th July.
