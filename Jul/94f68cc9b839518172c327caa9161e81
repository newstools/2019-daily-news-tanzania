THE National Electoral Commission (NEC) has, warned political parties that voice their complaints connected to election-related issues to the media instead of submitting them to it. It says the complaints can’t be addressed by the media but have to be handled through legal processes so that justice can be applied to all parties. That was said by the NEC Director of Elections, Dr Athuman Kihamia, during a presentation on the upgrade of the voters’ register, involving political parties, religious organs, the disabled, youth, women, civil society organizations and NEC officials. “With the presence of these ethical committees for resolving disputes and setting a competitive environment in re-elections, the parties have not been complaining to these committees, but have instead been voicing their complaints through the media,” he said. He cited some of the committees as related to electoral ethics, appeals, national ethics, province ethics and wards. The NEC Chairman, retired Judge Semistocles Kaijage, said Section 15 (5) of the national electoral law, chapter 343 read with section 21 (5) of the local election legislation gives the commission authority to improve the register of permanent voters. He also said the commission conducted a verification exercise of voter registration centers in the Kilimanjaro Region to increase registration centers from 1,273 to 1,286 centers. Secretary of Muslim General Assembly of Tanzania (Bakwata) , Kilimanjaro Region, Mr Awadhi Lema, wanted NEC to make arrangements for those who lost the voter cards to get replacements. The chairman of the Media Club of Kilimanjaro, (Mecki), Mr Bahat Nyakiraria, asked the commission to ensure that special groups are given priority.
