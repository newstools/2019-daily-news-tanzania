THE Tanzania Postal Bank (TPB) has handed over 1bn/- dividend to the government and another 200m/- to shareholders, from 700bn/- profit it got during the 2017/2018 financial year. Speaking during the handing over ceremony held at Dodoma’s Treasury Square, the bank’s chairman of the Board of Directors, Dr Edmund Mndolwa, said that the institution performed well in the last financial year, making a 17bn/- profit after paying all taxes. This enabled the bank to provide 1bn/- dividend to the government—the main shareholder, and another 200m/- was given to other shareholders. “As TPB board Chair, I feel very proud to continue supervising a financial institution which is performing well, considering that we have 54 banks in the country which are currently in the market… the shareholders are satisfied with the performance of the bank because we managed to get pre-tax profit of 17.2bn/-,’’ he said. Dr Mndolwa thanked the bank’s customers for trusting and placing confidence in his institution, promising to continue improving services to their expectations. Receiving the dividend, the Minister for Finance and Planning, Dr Philip Mpango, commended the bank for its outstanding performance, amongst the banks that are operating in the country. “I want to thank the bank for providing dividend to the government for two consecutive years, and this is an indication that public institutions can run themselves efficiently and profitably, thus competing with other private institutions,’’ he said. TPB has 75 branches as well as several shareholders, including the Union government. Others are the government of Zanzibar, Tanzania Posts Corporation, Saccos, Workers Compensation Fund (WCF), and Public Service Social Security Fund (PSSSF).
