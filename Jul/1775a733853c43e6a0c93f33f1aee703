AZAM FC Assistant Coach, Idd Cheche said their target to retain the Kagame Cup title remains intact despite a 1-0 defeat to U ganda’s KCCA on Tuesday. It was the first defeat for Azam during this year’s edition. The ‘ice cream makers’ won their opening group B match after beating Mukura FC 1-0 at Huye Stadium in Butare last Sunday. Azam are battling to win the title for the third time in a row and are using the contest to prepare for the Mainland Premier League and CAF Confederation Cup games respectively. Under the tutelage of new head coach, Etienne Ndayiragije, Azam are described by pundits as key favourites to win the top flight league honor next season, saying they have what it takes to do so. However, speaking via a radio interview after the match, Cheche said the downfall was part of the game and that their mission of claiming the title is still intact. “I accept the fact that we have lost but that is just part of football since you need to be ready for three results which are win, loss and draw,” Cheche said. He added that at the moment, the team has more new faces and the technical bench is working out to get the right chemistry because the players are yet to get used to each other. He promised to do better in their upcoming matches. Up next, Azam take on Bandari FC tomorrow in a match billed to be tough but thrilling. Coach Ndayiragije said he is using the platform to shape his team ahead of the incoming busy schedules which will see them trading in three competitions. The former KMC and Mbao FC coach is yet to win a silverware with a Tanzanian team and sees this endeavor as the best chance for him to shine.
