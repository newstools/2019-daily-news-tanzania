PRIME Minister Kassim Majaliwa has invited investors from Vietnam to come and invest in Tanzania, saying the country has everything it takes to establish profitable businesses. Mr Majaliwa was speaking at a meeting with Vietnamese Ambassador to Tanzania Nguyen Doanh. He said President John Magufuli had formed the Ministry of Investment in the Prime Minister’s Office to ensure Tanzania was a safe place for investors and their investments. “Tanzania has various opportunities for investors to set up investments in the industrial sector and other potential sectors of the economy,” he explained. Mr Majaliwa emphasised the establishment of industries that consumed agricultural raw materials produced in the country. “The government has continued creating an enabling environment for starting businesses. We are doing our best to put in place strategies that are friendly to investors in doing businesses,” he explained. He said Vietnam had advanced in textile industries and that Tanzanians would be happy to see such industries being established in their country. According to him, the production of quality cotton, cashew nuts, coffee and tobacco will ensure raw materials for industries. On the cashew nuts market, he said Tanzania had enough cashew nuts and traders from Vietnam were invited to engage in the business. For his part, Mr Doanh said Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh was expected to visit the country from July 9-11, this year and would arrive with 20 businesspersons from big companies in Vietnam.
