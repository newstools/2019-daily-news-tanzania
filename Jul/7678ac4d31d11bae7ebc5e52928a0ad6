TANZANIANS have been advised to go for local products as they have the best quality and in so doing motivate local manufacturers and boost the national economy. The advice was given here over the weekend by the Chief Executive Officer of the Koku Tuty Estate Winery, Ms Upendo Mwakajinga, ahead of the October wine festival corporate event being organized by the Dodoma Hut of Wine and Cheese. Ms Mwakajinga said her winery based in Dar es Salaam has the best brands known as Upendo Cana Feast and Balozi which have won markets not only within the country but also in East African countries. “The only challenge of the local wine manufacturers is the mindset among Tanzanians that the best wines are the imported ones; which is not the case as we have one of the best in taste and quality,” said Ms Mwakajinga. She said there was a need to engage the public to drink wine, which were linked with a certain class, but which is not the case; that there was therefore a need to change public perceptions. To make it work, she said, the company plans to have a number of packages which will cater for one’s economic status as well as increase the ration from the current red wine to white and champagne in the near future. She said wine manufacturing companies were still few despite the country’s richness in raw materials which the foreign manufacturers sought; hence the need to increase local production to boost farmers’ welfare and economy at large. Ms Mwakajinga commended the Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) and Tanzania Foods and Drugs Authority (TFDA) to smoothen the process of being certified. On her part, CEO of the Hut of Wine and Cheese, Ms Atwitye Makweta, said they want to market the local wine brands; thus during the October wine festival, stakeholders will get a chance to test a number of local brands. She said time is up to them to market the local brands and make them known to people all over the world and in so doing boost their sales.
