DECLINE of cotton prices in the international market has slowed down cotton buying season of 2019/20 as few companies have come up to buy the commodity. Stakeholders in the Western zone say that much of the crop had been collected by Agricultural Marketing Cooperatives Societies (AMCOS), in different places but the problem lay in delays in effecting payments. Tanzania Cotton Board General Manager in Western Zone Mr Jones Bwahama said that due to the decline of world market prices, the exercise had slowed down, but refuted claims that cotton was currently being purchased in credit. “Many farmers take cotton to AMCOS but companies don’t have enough money to buy all the cotton delivered by farmers,” clarified Mr Bwahama. Deputy Registrar of Cooperative Union in Mwanza Region, Mr Saulo Lunyeka, said that 226 AMCOS in the area had collected 7,789,469 kilogrammes of cotton worth 9,347,362,800/- until the end of June, but that only 2,209,376 kilogrammes worth 2,651,251,200/- had been bought so far. Nyanza Cooperative Union General Manager Ms Martha Ndetto said that many AMCOS are complaining about the slow pace of payments for the crop. She said delays in paying farmers promptly violated the government’s policy of ensuring that farmers were motivated.
