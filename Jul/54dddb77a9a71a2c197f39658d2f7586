DISGRUNTLED at Malinyi Water Project delay for three years now, Water Minister, Prof Makame Mbarawa, has issued a two-month ultimatum to contractors to complete it. According to a statement issued yesterday by the Water Ministry, Prof Mbarawa said contractors implementing the project will complete the project on their own costs. “Audacia Investment Limited and Inter Consult Limited will repair water infrastructure of Malinyi Water Project after failing to meet the required standard and supply water,” said the minister, who was on a visit to inspect water projects in Morogoro Region. Prof Mbarawa said residents should get access to safe and clean water supply in 75 days from yesterday, insisting the repair of water infrastructure worth 450m/- was the contractors’ mistake to implement the project. “The ministry will not pay any repair expenses of the water infrastructure because is not part of the project and it will not be responsible for any water project that fails to supply water in the country,” stressed the minister. Prof Mbarawa noted that the government would continue reviewing cost of the ongoing water project because the ministry had established that some water projects did not meet value for money. He directed water engineers and contractors implementing water projects to stick to professionalism. Following Prof Mbarawa’s directive, Morogoro Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Authority (Moruwasa), Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (Ruwasa), has entered into an agreement with Audacia Investment Limited and Inter Consult Limited to complete the project.
