SECURITY guards in private companies have been warned to avoid taking bribes and enticing freebies they may be offered while at their work stations. Issuing the warning at a seminar here yesterday for security guards, Dodoma Regional Police Commander (RPC), Gilles Muroto further cautioned them that some of the offers especially foodstuffs and drinks, may land them in trouble after being laced with drugs by people with bad intentions. “A security person ought to avoid all kinds of temptations when at work and you need to avoid eating things brought by people, because you may never know who your enemy is, because some may want to steal in the places you are manning,’’ he insisted. The RPC pointed out that continuous training to them was still necessary to help them acquire more knowledge as well as security techniques required in duties’ discharge professionally and efficiently. Equally, he emphasized on the need for them to capitalise on self-defence first while at work and protect weapons bestowed to them as well as properties of their employers. He also reminded them to protect properties in close areas to where they might be assigned and avoid colluding with other people in dubious deals, which are likely to jeopardise their responsibilities. Commenting, Tanzania Security Industry Association (TSIA) Central Zone Chairman, Lukanus Kayombo said the training was part of Inspector General of Police (IGP), Simon Sirro directive and strategy in a joint meeting he held with them on May 21, 2019 in Dar es Salaam. During that meeting, he said, they agreed that all security guards be given further training regardless of whether they had military one prior to joining their companies.
