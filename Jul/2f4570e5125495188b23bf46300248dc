THE Serengeti Breweries Limited (SBL), main sponsors of the national team, Taifa Stars have lauded Stars performance despite their early exit in the unfolding Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) finals. The country’s flag bearers in the continent’s biggest football competition failed to make it into the last 16 of the contest after losing all their three matches in group C against Senegal (2-0), Kenya (3-2) and Algeria (3-0). However, regardless of the premature exit, SBL congratulated the team, saying qualification alone to play in the group stages of the ongoing AFCON finals in Egypt was a big step forward for the entire nation. “To be able to qualify after so many years of failure, is in itself, a major step forward for our national team, at this stage, the players and everyone involved with team deserves credit,” said SBL’s Acting Marketing Director, Anitha Rwehumbiza recently in Dar es Salaam. She added that Stars’ performance in their three matches was pleasing even though they succumbed to defeats, while insisting on the team’s technical bench and players to never lose hope but look forward to do well in other upcoming editions. In his remarks, the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) General Secretary Wilfred Kidao thanked SBL for its tremendous support towards the national team calling it essential for the team’s success. “SBL have always been our good partners in development of football in the country. We highly appreciate their efforts because TFF alone, cannot manage to provide all the requirements for the national team,” he said. Apart from sponsoring Taifa Stars, SBL through Serengeti Lite brand are the major sponsors of Serengeti Lite Women’s League, which attract 12 women football teams from across the country. JKT Queens are the current champions of the league.
