SIHA District Council has spent a whopping 3.1bn/- in implementing an ambitious water project that will see its residents accessing safe and clean water. Siha District Executive Director Valerian Juwal said here yesterday that the project is in line with the government’s directive to save wananchi from the burden of trekking long distances in pursuit of the limited resource. “The government has prioritised implementation of several projects that aim at improving people’s livelihoods and water projects are part of the government’s plans and that is why we in the district have put in place strategies to ensure that the government’s initiatives are successful,” said Mr Juwal during his inspection of a number of water projects. According to Mr Juwal, under implementation is the Magadini-Makiwaru water project, which is particularly due for expansion and rehabilitation. The project, implemented at 1.2bn/-, is set to benefit the Wiri, Mawasiliano, Kandashi, Olkolili and Mkombozi villagers. Another project according to the DED is the Lawate-Fuka, which is being implemented at 1.4bn/- and expected to provide clean and safe water to Kishisha, Embukoi, Ngaritati and Naibili villagers. “We are also working on the construction and expansion of the Losaa-KIA water project at 25m/- to benefit residents of Munge kwa Lazaro Letiyo, Kiruswa-Sinai, Daniel Philipo area and Kobil Street,” he said. According to a 2017 World Health Organisation(WHO) report, 80 per cent of people who have to use unsafe and unprotected water sources live in rural areas, with around 159 million people collecting their drinking water from surface water like ponds and streams. Data from Unicef also indicate that over 700 children under five years die every day from diarrhoea due to unsafe water and poor sanitation. Goal Six of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) describes water and sanitation as core of sustainable development, critical to the survival of people and the planet.
