POLICE in Dodoma have managed to recover 12 out of 13 stolen cameras, property of National Identification Authority (NIDA) used for public registration, which were missing mysteriously. Dodoma Regional Police Commander (RPC), Gilles Muroto told reporters here yesterday that they are holding, Mr Ezekieli Subugo (24) an employee of the authority for allegedly stealing and selling them to some people. He said that the suspect banking on his position as a senior official with the authority stole the camera and sold them to some people, adding that he would be taken to court once investigations are completed. In another development, the RPC said another man is in their custody for allegedly being in possession of defence force uniforms. Mr Muroto named the suspect as Rajabu Kambi (23), adding that preliminary investigations showed that he was in a number of days and ways been accused of engaging in several criminal acts. “Kambi has been using the uniforms to get a number of services and threatening those who defy his directives,” he pointed out. The RPC said in several occasions, the suspect was wearing nurse uniforms, found in his possession, to get free medical attention, whenever he felt like. He also said that Kambi several times used to claim to be a bodaboda rider in order to get free rides in the Dodoma City. “The suspect at times could impersonate to be a Police Officer on a special mission because of a toy pistol he was wielding to hoodwink the public. He was arrested in possession of jungle green police uniforms, toy pistol and its hoister and a passport size taken while dressed in Tanzania People Defence Forces (TPDC) uniforms,” Mr Muroto added. He said that initial investigations revealed that the suspect had attended the National Services training and was dismissed on disciplinary grounds. Meanwhile, Innomax Investment Limited recently donated two motorbikes to the police force to boost security checks in the city.
