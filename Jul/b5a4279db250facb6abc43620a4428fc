TANZANIA has advised environmental scientists in the Great Lake Region to communicate their research findings in simple language that can easily be used by decision-makers to formulate workable policies regarding to natural ecosystem restoration. Speaking during a workshop on inland water monitoring and integrated ecosystem management in Africa in Dar es Salaam recently, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, Dr Rashid Tamatamah, noted that the pace of publication of researched information in the region had increased significantly over the recent decades. “This is evidenced, for instance, by an increase in the number and breadth of researched publications in the past few years, but let them be communicated in simple to bring more impact,” he added. The workshop, which included training and practical research on rivers in Dar es Salaam Region, was organised by the governments of Tanzania and China and attended by representatives from Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania and Ethiopia. China donated ultra-modern laboratory equipment worth $30,000 to enhance the training workshop. Addressing the workshop on behalf of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNDP), chief scientist Liu Jian, who was also a representative from the China Republic, said the natural environment of Africa was still virgin and was characterised by natural ecology. Mr Liu Jian noted that “Africa is the hope of the world which has the youngest population and enough labour force”. Mr Liu further urged all environmental scientists from the Great Lake Region to apply the skills they acquired from the workshop to foster fishing activities and maintain ecology in the region.
