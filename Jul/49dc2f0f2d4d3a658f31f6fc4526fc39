INVESTMENTS in agro-processing are set to grow thanks to a stable monetary policy maintained by Bank of Tanzania (BoT). This was said in Dar es Salaam yesterday by the BoT Senior Economist from the Directorate of Economic Research and Policy, Mr Bonaventure Mlamka at the ongoing 43rd Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair taking place along Kilwa road grounds. “The Bank is keen in creating conducive environment for attracting more investments in the agro processing and the whole value chain by putting in place stable monetary policy,” he said. He said what the Bank is doing supports the theme of the 43rd DITF that stating that ‘value addition on agro products for industrial development’ “Increased investment in value addition will agriculture sector contribution to economic growth more substantial and support the government in the efforts to bring out people from poverty,” he said. He said for example maintaining inflation in single digit guarantees investors in agro processing sector that their goods will compete in both domestic and foreign markets. Also to give investors opportunity to borrow from commercial banks in order to bolster their investment in agro process activities, BoT provides lenders with sufficient liquidity in order to meet investors demand for loan. Where commercial banks lend more to the agriculture value chain, the sector’s contributions in creating jobs, farmers earnings and supporting the growth of the economy will increase. The Bank is also supporting importers and exporters activities by ensuring that the shilling remains stable thus creating conducive and predictable environment for smooth business operations. He added that the Bank’s reports from various findings are very useful in advising the government on matters related to the economy.
