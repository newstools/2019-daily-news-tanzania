NMB Bank has issued over 600bn/- soft loans to petty traders as well as other small scale business entrepreneurs countrywide in the last three years. Dodomaâ€™s NMB Head of Business Banking, Donatus Richard, said while addressing a one day NMB Business Club forum they organized to the traders in the capital city recently. He further said that the bank organized the forum to train and enlighten them on how to save money and run their business premises professionally and realize their profits. Mr Richard said the Club would also impart knowledge to the traders on how to seek markets, improve services and quality of their products to clients/customers and pay the government its dues. The Head of Business Banking said with the training and soft loans issued to them, the traders would be at a position to grow their businesses and employ others. He further said so far the bank has initiated 36 Club branches countrywide with over 150 to 300 members in each organisation. However, he appealed to the traders as well as other small scale entrepreneurs who borrow money from financial institutions to build the culture of remitting back payments on time to enable others also to benefit from such programmes. NMB Dodoma Region Club Assistant Chairperson Joyce Kaishozi said that the club members would be ambassadors of the bank to raise awareness for others to take soft loans.
