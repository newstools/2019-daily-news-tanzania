UGANDA champions Kampala City Council Authority (KCCA) defeated Azam 1-0 in Kagame Cup group B match at Huye stadium in Butare Rwanda yesterday. Happy Seedat Annapu scored the winner in the 49th minute following Azam’s defensive laxity to deal with counter attack. The loss has also removed Azam from the group’s top, which is now occupied by KCCA with four points. Azam have remained second with three points, while Bandari, who drew 2-2 with Mukura at the same venue yesterday, are placed third above Mukura with a point after the yesterday draw. Azam looked menacingly hungry for victory right from the start. Zimbabwean international Bruce Kangwa was Azam key player at the middle of terrain, but KCCA defenders couldn’t let his passes reach Obrey Chirwa and Donald Ngoma upfront. During their first match on Sunday, it was an own goal by Mukura FC defender that gifted Azam FC a crucial 1-0 victory in their opening match of the underway CECAFA Kagame Cup contest held at Huye Stadium in Rwanda. The goal came from a smartly taken corner kick which took a slight deflection from Azam striker Idd Seleman’s header in the 77th minute which landed into the back of the net. Seleman made his debut for Azam after signing a one year contract from Mbeya City and revealed that he is a good player provided he is given enough time to get used with his colleagues. It was a good start for the defending champions Azam who are looking to retain the title for third successive time.
