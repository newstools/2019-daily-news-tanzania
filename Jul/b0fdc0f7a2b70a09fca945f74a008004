TANZANIA Building Agency (TBA) has threatened to take legal action against its tenants as outstanding rate reaches 10bn/-. TBA, however, before taking stern measures reminded its tenants to pay their house rent arrears within 14 day of grace period that ends Friday. The TBA’s acting Chief Executive, Mr Said Mndeme, told the press conference in Dar es Salaam yesterday that settlement of the arrears focused all tenants of the public building including public servants, traders and institutions. “TBA is insisting that there is no more grace period for those tenants who fail to comply. Tenants should make sure they clear their debts within the grace period offered,” he insisted. The 14-day notice was issued on the fourth of Saturday last month and ends this Friday. Mr Mndeme said after the passing of the deadline, the TBA will engage court broker to evict the tenants who failed to settle their rent bills by force. In another development, Mr Mndeme said TBA is planning to bring before the court of law all evicted tenants who have yet to settle their house rents. He said rental defaulters after the deadline passed their names will be published in various media houses before arrested and charged. The Agency is also making contact with defaulter’s employers to make sure the relevant public servant clear his/her house rent in due time.
