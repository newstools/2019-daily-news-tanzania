PERMANENT Secretary (PS) in the Ministry of State, President’s Office, Regional Administration and Local Government, Joseph Nyamhanga has ordered quick execution of strategic projects on progress in various parts of the country. According to Mr Nyamhanga, the government has set aside over 200bn/- to implement the projects in various councils, across the country. “Execution of the projects has started in some areas but work has not started in other parts and the provided reasons are not acceptable,” the PS warned in Tarime Town Council over the weekend. He issued the warning while he inspected the construction site for a modern market in Tarime town. The market is among the strategic projects, which seek to increase revenues of councils and enable them to provide better services to the citizens. The market is expected to cost over 8bn/- upon completion. Mr Nyamhanga directed construction of the market to start immediately and be completed as soon as possible. “Even here in Tarime, we lag behind and the reasons given are not acceptable, there is need to speed up construction,” Mr Nyamhanga instructed. He further warned, “We will be coming back to inspect the progress not only in Tarime Town Council but also in other councils implementing the strategic projects.” He said that Tarime Town is one of the councils with shortage of revenue sources, arguing that completion of the project market project is imperative. Besides raising revenue, the market will also create better environment for traders and buyers to interact. Officials in Tarime Town Council attributed the project delay to the consultant engineer who is working on the structural design.
