DAR ES SALAAM Stock Exchange (DSE) has doubled its profit after tax on quarterly basis thanks to the increase in investment income and listing fees. The self-listed bourse net profit doubled to 390m/- in second quarter this year to 185m/- posted in the previous quarter. According to a Tanzania Securities Limited (TSL) report, the increase was in tandem with a 15 per cent increase in revenue to 1.3bn/-mainly due to upward movements in listing fees by 12 per cent to 608m/- while transaction fees by 20 per cent to 177m/- and investment income increased by 29 per cent to 446m/-. “Despite dwindling performance at the bourse in terms of turnover— a 30 per cent decrease from first quarter— DSE managed to register an increase in its profit particularly due to the increase in investment income and listing fees,” TSL said in the statement issued over the weekend. TSL said bond listing namely the TMRC and NMB bonds, accounted for the increase in listing fees due to the fact that no new company was listed during the quarter. “Had there been new listings of companies and with foreign investor participation, better results would have been witnessed,” the stock brokerage firm said. New listings are anticipated as the year progresses and this is likely to lead to even better performance for the DSE. The financial statement showed that registry and CSD fees was the only revenue item that declined from 132m/-to 51m/- during the quarter under review. Operationally, staff costs edged up by 18m/- to 634m/-, operating expenses increased to 80m/- while administrative expenses shrunk by 17 per cent to 256m/-, which saw total company expenses decline slightly from 993m/- to 971m/-. Earnings per share doubled to 16/- from 8/- recorded in the previous quarter. Total Assets of the Group stood at 22bn/-. DSE share price declined by 27 per cent to close at 1,100/- at the end of June from 1,400/- at January. The bourse net profit margin jumped to 29 per cent from 15 per cent in the previous quarter while return on equity stood at 1.0 per cent. “It appears that there were better cost management practices by DSE, which saw total operating expenses decline,” TSL said. The profit after tax halved to 575m/- compared to 1.27bn/-in the similar period last year.
