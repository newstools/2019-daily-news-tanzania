WORKS, Transport and Communications Minister Isack Kamwelwe yesterday exposed dirty games by some unscrupulous individuals to get money during bidding for execution of major construction projects. Engineer Kamwelwe said some people were part of his level, holding top ministerial posts. “There is now a tendency that once a tender has been announced, people start to organise themselves on how to help a contractor win the bidding through corrupt means and get money,” he noted with concern. He added: “Some of these individuals are leaders like me and fortunately they don’t approach me because they will end up with insults.” The minister cited the Stiegler’s Gorge project and the Kigongo-Busisi bridge construction projects as among projects that experienced the misconduct. “My dears, we cannot look for money through such means. Thanks that such people have never come to my office because they will end up being disappointed,” he charged. Engineer Kamwelwe reminded that the government has its institution dealing with tendering process, the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA), advising people to follow proper procedures when bidding. He advised individuals who used to get money through evil means of posing as middlemen, promising contractors to soothe the government officials with corruption to win tenders to think of new decent means of earning money. Some people have been sending texts or writing to Chief Executive Officer of the Tanzania National Roads Agency (TANROADS) seeking favour in the tendering process, charged the minister. He said the government will always give tenders to the lowest evaluated bidder but not to the lowest price bidder, saying tendering is a technical matter that politicians have nothing to do with.
