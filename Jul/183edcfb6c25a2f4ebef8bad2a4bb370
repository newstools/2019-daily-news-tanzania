THE Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB), in Manyara Region has faulted Point of Sale (POS) machines for occasioning the Hanang District Council a 9mln/-loss. The anti-corruption watchdog alleges that the machines were switched to ‘offline’ mode, thus denying the district huge sums of money that could have been collected as the district’s revenues. Briefing reporters here yesterday, PCCB Regional Head, Fidelis Kalungura took issue with those operating the POS machines for not taking the devices for regular maintenance, thus causing the district such loss. “Our investigations have revealed that the operators weren’t taking the machines for maintenance,” explained the regional PCCB boss while shedding light on the anti-corruption watchdog’s performance between April and June this year. According to Mr Kalungura, the lost money would go uncounted for by the central government due to the faults in the POS machines. The POS machines are electronic devices introduced by the government with a view of processing card payments at retail locations. They were also rolled out in a bid to improve transparency in revenue collection and expenditure in councils, thus blocking loopholes for leakage of revenues. In the same vein, the PCCB regional boss disclosed that his office in the region has saved more than 9mn/-through the Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS), system. The system whose function is to improve service delivery in a way that it better responds to the needs of citizens traces the flow of resources through the different bureaucratic layers and demonstrates how much of the intended budget reaches each layer.
