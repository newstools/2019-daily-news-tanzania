THE National Insurance Fund (NHIF) has installed electronic systems in a significant number of health facilities to curb misuse of its cards and check embezzlement. NHIF Kinondoni Regional Manager Innocent Mauki told the ‘Daily News’ at the ongoing 43rd Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair that the fund has also established special departments being run by medical doctors to check the services provided by credited facilities. “These departments are responsible for verifying whether patients have received appropriate services which also determine the payments of the accredited health care providers, “ Mr Mauki said. He said that the systems installed in hospitals were also used for making verification of members before they receive services from the fund in order to curb abuse of beneficiaries’ cards. “The installed systems have helped a lot in reducing abuse of beneficiaries cards including forgery and accessing similar services which they had received in one of the accredited health facilities unless it is an emergency,” he said. He said they were confident that the electronic systems installed have increased not only efficiency to the fund but also reduce forgery of members cards unless the health care provider decide to side with a patient. Mr Mauki, however, said that , they were expecting to provide various services during the Saba saba exhibitions to members and non-members who will visit the pavilion. He said the services offered included registration of new members, educating the public about the benefits of joining NHIF and the services offered. “We also want to create awareness of our services to private companies which are yet to join the fund.”
