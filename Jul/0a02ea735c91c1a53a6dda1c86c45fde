THE Amref Health Africa partnered with the Azania Bank Limited (ABL) over the weekend in Dar es Salaam for a charity walk aimed at deployment of more midwives to assist for Safe Delivery. Dubbed ‘Stand Up for African Mothers’, the event was graced by the Minister for Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children Ummy Mwalimu, who represented Vice President Samia Hassan on the day. Addressing participants at the event, Amref Health Africa Tanzania Country Director Florence Temu said this year’s campaign was specifically conducted to raise awareness to the members of the public about the importance of having skilled midwives to assist in the safe delivery of pregnant mothers. “Our main goal is to raise 1bn/- for the period of three years beginning this year which will be used to make sure that enough midwives are deployed in various health centers countrywide who will be tasked to facilitate safe delivery of pregnant mothers before and after giving birth,” she said. She added that midwives play a key role in providing quality health care services hence called upon stakeholders both public , private sectors and development partners to continue to contribute towards meeting this goal in order to save lives of mothers and children in different health facilities across the nation. In his remarks, ABL Managing Director Charles Itembe said the bank will continue to support health sector as part and parcel of fulfilling its corporate social responsibilities. “Women play a key part in social and economic development that is why we have stepped on board to help in reducing high maternal mortality rates among them,” he said. He then lauded Amref for being on the front pedal to enhance improvement in critical areas such as health and education.
