TANZANIANS should take insurance as a basic necessity and seek to understand products available in the market, the Deputy Minister for Finance and Planning Dr Ashatu Kijaji said in Kondoa District recently. The Deputy Minister was speaking during the inauguration and handover ceremony of two classrooms, a staffroom and 40 desks for Lusangi Primary school located in the district, whose construction was bankrolled by a 49m/- grant from Sanlam Insurance. “People genuinely need insurance to give them cover against uncertainties,” said the deputy minister, adding that the gesture by Sanlam to plough back part of its profit back to the society through support of social project should serve as a reminder and wake-up call on how crucial insurance is for secure life. Speaking at the event, Regional Executive Officer, Sanlam Pan-Africa – East Africa, Julius Magabe, reiterated the insurance conglomerate’s commitment to supporting social projects in Tanzania. “Let me assure you that Sanlam will cooperate with the government of Tanzania in supporting community development initiatives,” he said, adding that the company - which celebrated its 100th anniversary last year, is committed to return back part of its profits to help the community. Earlier, the Head teacher of the school, Josephine Paul, noted that the school was faced with acute shortage of classrooms, as the five available could not accommodate the pupil population of 348. “The completion of this project has contributed to alleviating the shortage of classrooms and staffroom which have persisted for long,” she said.
