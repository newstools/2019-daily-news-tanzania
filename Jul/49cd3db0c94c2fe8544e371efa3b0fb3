MAIZE farmers in the Lake Zone Region have been badly affected by fall army-worms, followed by Northern and Eastern regions, a recent study shows. The study conducted in 18 regions says the species destroyed almost half of the crop cultivated in the last farming season. The national research team leader of fall armyworms, who is also a senior lecturer of Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA), Prof. Gration Rwegasira, told ‘Daily news’ that the fall army-worms had invaded the Lake Zone, including Simiyu, Mara, Mwanza, Geita and Kagera, followed by the Northern and Eastern zones. Prof. Rwegasira said they had conducted research to determine how the species attacked maize and other crops. The regions affected in the Northern and Eastern regions Tanga, Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Manyara and Morogoro. He also said other areas affected were in the Western Zone, including Tabora, Rukwa, Katavi and Dodoma followed by the Southern Highlands regions of Ruvuma, Njombe, Mbeya and Iringa. The researcher said farmers were struggling to kill the fall army-worm using various methods, including using ash and sand. He pointed out that education should be provided to communities especially farmers on how to control the fall army-worms in the country. The worms, according to the researcher, also attack sorghum, vegetable crops, legumes and cotton.
