THE government yesterday reaffirmed its commitment of working with different religious denominations for the country’s prosperity. Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa says faith-based organizations played a crucial role in complementing the fifth phase government’s agenda. “Your contribution to the country’s welfare cannot be overlooked,” said the Premier while addressing Tanzania Assemblies of God(TAG) worshippers when he graced the church’s 80th anniversary and the implementation of its 10-year strategic plan. The Premier said the TAG church was, and continues to be instrumental in complementing the government’s development agenda through provision of key social services. He singled out TAG’s contribution to the increase of primary school pupil enrollment, saying, admission was up from 78 per cent in 2012 to 83 per cent last year. “The church has done a remarkable job in complimenting the government’s agenda,” he said. In the same vein, the PM urged TAG leaders throughout the country to use their pulpits to preach peace. According to Mr Majaliwa, clerics were vested with the responsibility of maintaining peace, joy, harmony, love and healing through the spread of the gospel. He urged the leaders to refrain from being causes of social ill that denigrate social morals. The PM assured the head of TAG church that he would look into issues connected with their church’s 11 containers that are currently being held at the Dar es Salaam Port. Earlier, TAG’s Archbishop Dr Barnabas Mtokambali, informed the prime minister that the containers which contained mattresses, were being held awaiting tax exemption. “The more the ports authority holds onto the containers, the more they cripple our provision of social services,” he observed. Dr Mtokambali further told the PM that the 80-year-old church had been through thick and thin throughout its existence in Tanzania.
