FARMERS have been advised to take good care of irrigation schemes and infrastructure management for increased agricultural produce. The advice was given here yesterday by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture, Eng Mathew Mtigumwe in his speech read on his behalf by Director of Training and Research Department, Mr Wilhelm Mafuru during a joint irrigator’s competition workshop here. The competition will include 36 irrigation scheme societies that aimed at motivating farmers on irrigation scheme and capacity building training for increased farm produce. TANCAID II through JICA in collaboration with the National Irrigation Commission organised the workshop, among others to share ideas on how best they can improve irrigation scheme infrastructures. He said the country has benefited significantly from the financial and technical support from the Japanese government, saying they are enjoying financial support in the agricultural sector, particularly in irrigation development. He cited some of the technical cooperation to include development of lower Moshi irrigation scheme, formulation of National Irrigation Master Plan 2002 (NIMP), Formulation and Dissemination of the Irrigation Comprehensive Guidelines and the Project for Capacity Development for the Promotion of Irrigation Development Scheme Under the DADPs” Phase Ⅱ (TANCAID Ⅱ). “We believe this project has the potential to improve and promote irrigation development schemes in line with Comprehensive Guidelines and it has also enhanced the capacities of zonal and district irrigation staff,” said Eng Mtigumwe He added that regardless of the small development in irrigation facilities, sustainability has been a challenge due to lack of proper operation and maintenance of irrigation schemes. The Permanent Secretary said TANCAID II Project has done a significant job through capacity building on operation and maintenance, specifically on how to use the comprehensive guidelines and manuals for water distribution and repair work. He said the ministry through NIRC will ensure sustainable irrigation development as well as mainstreaming project’s activities during implementation of the Revised Irrigation Master Plan (2018) together with up scaling of the national irrigation database.
