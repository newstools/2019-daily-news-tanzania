PRIME Minister Kassim Majaliwa has arrived in Egypt for a three-day official tour, which is set to strengthen trade relations between Tanzania and Egypt as well as boost the investment sector in the country. The premier arrived in Egypt along with the Minister for Agriculture, Mr Japhet Hasunga and other government officials. During his visit, Mr Majaliwa is scheduled to pay a courtesy call on Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and will later hold discussions with his host, Prime Minister of Egypt, Dr Moustafa Madbuoly. The PM is also expected to meet various Egyptian business persons and Tanzanians who live in Egypt. Mr Majaliwa is furthermore expected to visit various development projects and see the possibility of drawing expertise from Egyptians. Among the projects to be visited include construction and agriculture. Among them is the new administrative city, fish farming, leather processing factories and Maritime Training and Stimulation Centre. Mr Majaliwa is also due to tour the New Suez Canal. He will witness the signing of various Memorandums of understanding (MoU) including the one on media cooperation between Tanzania Standard Newspapers Limited (TSN) and the Middle East News Agency (MENA).
