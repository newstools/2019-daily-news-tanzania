MKULAZI sugar project, which is expected to reduce sugar deficit in the country, is set to be connected to electricity by end of next month for enhancing irrigation farming. The move intends to make the farms, located at Mbigiri in Morogoro region, produce throughout the year, according to the Managing Director of Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO), Dr Tito Mwinuka. The project covers over 1500 hectares of land for sugar plantation and factory. It is implemented by Mkulazi Holding Company Ltd (MHCL), which is a joint venture company currently owned by National Social Security Fund (NSSF) and Tanzania Prisons Service. The principle activity of the company is to undertake production and importation of sugar. Plans to connect the project with electricity were unveiled after the TANESCO MD visited the area, according to a statement to the media yesterday. During his visit, the two shareholders of the MHCL appealed to TANESCO to connect power to the project. During his visit, Dr Mwinuka had a chance to assess the area and see possibility of erecting electric poles to connect the power. “We will do our best to ensure that power comes to this area in time to facilitate activities for sugarcane production. I promise that we will not fail you,” Dr Mwinuka assured the shareholders. NSSF Managing Director, William Erio thanked TANESCO for its promise to bring electricity to the project. “We are glad that they have assured us of bringing electricity before the end of August, which will encourage us to go ahead with plans for investment,” he said. Commissioner General of the Tanzania Prison Service, Phaustine Kasike explained how they have organised themselves to ensure that sugarcane production increases. “We have manpower to serve this farm. All activities will be done by prisoners and we are certain that we will achieve our goals,” he said.
