MILK production in the country is expected to surge to 3.8 billion litres in five years period, from 2.4 billion litres registered in the financial year ended 2017/18, which is an increase of 77 percent. An official from the Tanzania Diary Board, Deogratius Mlay made the remarks at the 43rd Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair (DITF), while commenting on the Tanzania Livestock Master Plan (TLMP) 2017/18 – 2021/22. “Productivity improvement interventions in the dairy cow production system will result in 31 percent increase in the average annualized milk productivity of a cow in traditional and improved family dairy subsystem, and a 26-percent increase in commercial specialized dairy,” he said. According to the TLMP, the national average annualized milk production of a cow will increase from 179 litres to 254 litres over five years (2016/17–2021/22). Though most of this change is expected to come from improvement and increased production by dairy cows, improvement of cattle for red meat production will also contribute to milk production. Milk consumption in the country is still very low at an average of 20 percent or 46 litres annually compared to global average of 200 litres recommended. Currently, there are 76 milk industries ranging from 500 litres capacity per day to over 120,000 litres capacity per day. Similarly, during dry season, milk productions tend to drop due to absence of sufficient pastures to feed the animals. Despite being ranked second in Africa in terms of cattle population, according to the country’s National Bureau of Statistics, livestock-related activities contribute only 7.4 percent to Tanzania’s gross domestic product (GDP) and growth of the livestock sector at 2.6 per cent is low. The traditional cow meat milk production subsystem is not specialized on a single commodity, and both milk and meat are important products. However, milk is a priority commodity in improved family dairy and commercial specialized dairy subsystems. Thus, with additional investments there could be a surplus of about 0.5 million litres of milk in 2031/32, which would provide raw material for domestic industries and export, after meeting domestic consumption requirements.
