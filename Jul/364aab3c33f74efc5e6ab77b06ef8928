FOUR Tanzanian referees have been appointed by the continental football governing body (CAF), to officiate Champions League and Confederation Cup matches of this season. Alongside the four referees, CAF has also appointed two match commissioners for similar mission. The news is a big relief to Tanzanian referees who previously seemed to have lost CAF trust. As unveiled by the Communication officer from Tanzania Football Federation (TFF), Clifford Ndimbo named Elly Sasii as a Tanzanian referee appointed to officiate the Champions League match between Aigle Noir of Burundi and the Kenyan champions Gor Mahia to be held at Prince Louis Rwagasore stadium in Bujumbura, Burundi on August 11th, 2019. According to Ndimbo, Sasii will be assisted by Frank Komba and Ferdinand Chacha as assistants while Emmanuel Mwandembwa will be a reserve referee. The match commissioner during the match is Rwandan Gaspard Kayijuka. In retrospect, CAF has also appointed Tanzanian, Ahmed Mgoyi to serve as a Commissioner of the return leg in Nairobi. The return leg between the Burundian and Kenyan champions will be staged between August 23rd, 24th and 25th . Another Tanzanian Khalid Abdallah has been appointed by CAF to officiate the CAF Confederation Cup match between Proline FC of Uganda and Master Security Services of Malawi to be staged at Kampala Startimes stadium in Uganda. All four referees; Sasii, Mwandembwa, Chacha, and Komba hold FIFA badges. The decision by FIFA to award them its badge marks yet another achievement for the countryâ€™s referees.
