A LOGISTICS and transport sector stakeholder has called for establishment of a professional board to regulate the logistics and transport profession. The president of the Chattered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT), Tanzania Chapter, Dr George Makuke said in Dar es Salaam yesterday that Tanzania needed well trained transport and logistics professionals as well as a board to govern their activities like in other professions such as legal, accountancy and engineering. “Why no logistics transport professional governing board in the country at this time when there great efforts to develop energy and transport infrastructure,” he asked at the first smart infrastructure summit. “Mega infrastructures like roads, airports, expansion of ports of Dar es Salaam, Mtwara and Tanga and purchase of new ships to ply in Lakes Victoria, Nyasa and Tanganyika and revamping of the Air Tanzania means the logistics and transportation sector is growing and therefore needs special professional governance and coordination so that it can be part of economic uplifting to attain the middle income status,” he insisted. Dr Makuke warned that it would be utopia to think of safer roads, better transport infrastructure management, traffic planning, smart cities planning would promote economic advancement without considering professionalism among the key players. The Permanent Secretary from the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communication (Transport Sector) Dr Leonard Chamuriho who officiated the summit said that the issue of connectivity to the land locked countries was being given deserving weight in the development vision 2025.
