TANZANIA Mortgage Refinance Company (TMRC) yesterday listed second segment of its 120bn/- five-year bond on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE), giving hopes of more reduction of interest rate in mortgage loans. Finance and Planning Ministry, Deputy Permanent Secretary Dr Khatibu Kazungu officiated the listing of the mortgage bond in Dar es Salaam, saying existence of the TMRC has enabled reduced interests of the loans. “Existence of the TMRC would make the loans become more affordable,” Dr Kazungu said when speaking on behalf of the Deputy Minister of the portfolio, Dr Ashatu Kijaji. Before TMRC was introduced eight years ago average mortgage loans interest rate was 25 per cent, but soon after commenced operations rate dropped to a current average of 16 per cent. Also, time of loan payment has also increased from an average of between five and seven years to between 15 and 25 years. Dr Kazungu said the aim of the government was to enable citizens to get safe and better homes. Beneficiaries of the TMRC mortgage loans are the low income earners, middle and high income earners as well. TMRC Chairman Mr Theobald Sabi said that during this second tranche, the company managed to collect 9.2bn/-, an over subscription of 16.05 per cent, the initially offer planned to raise 8bn/-. Last year the TMRC issued its first tranche of 12bn/- and was oversubscribed by 4.0 per cent. “Success in this second tranche is a result of trust that the TMRC has earned from its investors,” he said. Mr Sabi noted that the TMRC is in talks with international financial institutions seeking to get soft loans that would enable it continue giving soft loans to the local banks in order to relieve a final consumer from paying on high interest rate. He commended the government for its efforts in developing real estate sector in the country. Currently, the contribution of the sector to the national income is still low; it contributes by less than one per cent into the GDP.
