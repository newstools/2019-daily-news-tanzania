MINISTER for Energy, Dr Medard Kalemani, has urged Rural Energy Agency (REA) and Tanesco to take action against engineers who delay the implementation of rural power projects. Moreover, the minister has urged REA and Tanesco from next week to visit at all project sites and inspect engineers and directed them to terminate the contracts of underperforming engineers. Dr Kalemani said this in Dar es Salaam at a meeting to discuss how to effectively implement rural power projects. The meeting involved various stakeholders, including financial institutions, engineers, contractors and suppliers of electrical appliances. “Contracts need engineers, who have the wherewithal and competent skills. I am surprised to hear that engineers do not have money to implement power projects as planned. I need you to work, use your capital, then you will be paid as we agreed in the contracts,” he said. Either, he urged REA to take legal action against engineers, who would fail to implement the projects on time as stipulated in the contracts, including not involving them in other projects in the future. He said the government had set aside over 600bn/- for letter of credit for local use through the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) for the purchase of quality electrical appliances for the implementation of power projects (phase 3) scheduled for completion in December this year. He said the projects would benefit 3,559 villages. Dr Kalemani noted that the government’s plan was to ensure by 2021 all villages countrywide had power. He further urged REA to complete payment for engineers and other companies that implemented power projects on time according to contract. According to him, studies show that Tanzania is leading for having power in rural areas compared to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. He said up to now about 10,128 villages had access to electricity.
