WHILE perceptions on the extent of the corruption problem vary considerably across the continent, President John Magufuli’s efforts to fight against it has not gone in vain as a report by Transparency International’s (TI) Global Corruption Barometer Africa cited Tanzania to be among the nations that are excelling in the fight against the vice. According to the report, 71 per cent of the Tanzanian population thinks their government is doing a good job of tackling corruption, with the remaining 23 per cent still in doubt. Since President Magufuli assumed the top seat in 2015, the nation has been in a concerted war against corruption, misconduct of officials who abuse their offices and institutions that oppress citizens while infringing their rights. According to the report, among 35 nations in Africa, Tanzania has taken a lead on how her citizens perceive the government’s positive progress in tackling matters of corruption; other countries being Sierra Leone, Lesotho, Nigeria, and Ghana. The report revealed that 50 per cent of the Tanzanian population thinks that ordinary citizens can make a difference in the war against corruption, instead of leaving the entire fight to the government alone. The TI report has shown great progress in the President’s and Prime Minister’s offices with the decrease of corruption activities from 15 to 4 per cent and from 21 to 8 per cent for members of parliament, government officials from 25 to 12 per cent, judges and magistrates from 36 to 21 per cent. The decrease is between the reports of 2015 and the recent of 2019. Business executives have decreased their corrupt practices from 37 to 32 per cent; while for religious leaders it is from 10 to 3 per cent and for traditional leaders the percentage has decreased from 13 to 3 per cent. Even though many people feel that corruption in the police force is rife, the institution has reduced it from 42 to 34 per cent. The report also revealed that, bribery rates based on people who used public services, have decreased from 25 to 18 per cent; public clinics and health centres from 20 to 11 per cent, public schools from 11 to 4 per cent. The statistics are a comparison of the TI reports of the year 2015 and 2019. On the question of corruption level changes in the previous 12 months, the data has revealed that only 10 per cent of the citizens said it had increased, which is very low compared to the 2015 report where 66 per cent of the citizens said it had increased. Those who said corruption activities had decreased are 72 per cent this year, which is a considerable rise compared to 13 per cent of 2015 while 9 per cent of the population said that the corruption situation had remained the same. The percentage of the population that has agreed that the government is doing a good job in the war against corruption has risen from 37 per cent (2015) to 71 per cent (2019); and the number of those who disagreed had declined from 58 per cent (2015) to 23 per cent.
