THE Government Chemist Laboratory Agency (GCLA) has appreciated cooperation from dealers of fertilisers and farmers bringing their manure samples for chemical testing before sales, seen as a positive gesture in the growth of agricultural sector. The appreciation was made over the weekend in Dar es Salaam by GCLA Senior Chemist, Faustine Mwanjala, while addressing the ‘Daily News’ over their authority’s contribution in the development of agro processing sector in the country. “We also test agricultural products before releasing them to industries for processing so that the factories process safe products for consumption,” further said Mr Mwanjala, adding that the GCLA participation at the 43rd Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair (DITF) was to educate the public on their role in growth of agro processing sector in public. “The big response from fertiliser dealers and farmers was as a result of public education,” he added. The Senior Chemist noted that in the past fertiliser manufacturers were producing low quality products and that was affecting farmers’ yields in harvests. “However, through the GCLA the government managed to control the situation and check quality of the fertilisers. Now farmers apply and use the fertilisers with assurance that they are using safe fertilisers,” he said, citing cashew nuts farmers in Southern Tanzania who use sulphur fertilisers. He said application of sulphur fertilisers after the GCLA intervention to check their chemical content has helped in bringing efficiency in the crop’s farming in the area.
