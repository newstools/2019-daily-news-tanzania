TOP snooker player Arjun Lavingia hit the highest break of 64 points so far, as the June Snooker Monthly Mug tournament set to wind up today at the Dar es Salaam Gymkhana Club (DGC). The R&K Trucking Ltd sponsored two-week long tournament, which is organised by Dar es Salaam Gymkhana Club (DGC) snooker section, will be closed today with two final matches on the card. Snooker Vice-Captain Atish Chohan told the ‘Sunday News’ in Dar es Salaam yesterday that preparations for today’s final are complete. Chohan said the competition is going on well so far and the final will be held as planned. He said Lavingia, who beat Mohamed Sammy 2-1 in the Division A semi-final clash held on Friday night is also leading on highest break of 64 points. In another match played on Friday night, Upanga’s Pratik Dauda beat host Nul Patadia by 2-0 frames victory in the Division B quarterfinal clash. “We expect to have two finals today. It will be Division A and Division B best of three battles,” he said. Chohan said over 40 players from two clubs -- Upanga Sports Club and hosts Dar Gymkhana have been battling it out for the top honors. “We are happy that we received good number of players this time around… 40 players for monthly mug is exciting. The competition is also thrilling given that it is the first event to be staged at the refurbished snooker room that re-opened last month. In the previous event, Chohan won Division B title that saw him being promoted to Division A. However, he found the going tough. DGC snooker section recently made some initiatives to upgrade snooker room and tables in an effort to promote the game and attract as many new players as possible.
