THE government is preparing a national policy on quality assurance in which various stakeholders will be involved in its formulation, a cabinet minister said yesterday. The policy formulation, the first of its kind in the country, has begun under the sponsorship of non-profit company, TradeMark East Africa. Deputy Minister for Industry and Trade, Stella Manyanya disclosed in Dar es Salaam at an event to mark World Accreditation Day organised by Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS). “The crafting of the policy derives its legitimacy from the fact that in many developing countries the establishment of accreditation bodies has remained a big challenge due lack of a quality assurance policy on quality infrastructure,” the minister said. The East African Quality Assurance, Metrology and Testing Act, 2006 requires every member state to classify laboratories that will be used to test imported goods entering the East African Community (EAC). “To supervise the implementation of this law,” the minister said “the government, through her ministry, will form a national accreditation taskforce, whose major responsibility will be to advise the government on the matter.” Another key responsibility of the task force will be to mobilise various institutions engaged in calibration, testing, inspection and product certification in adding value to supply chain. The minister said the task-force would be constituted by representatives from public and private institutions “since all of us are engaged in building our national economy.”
