COFFEE farmers in Kagera region have been told to establish Agricultural and Marketing Cooperative Societies (AMCOS) in order to qualify to get loans from financial institutions. Tanzania Commission for Cooperatives’ Chief Executive Officer, Mr Edmund Massawe gave the advice yesterday while conducting sensitization seminars to the farmers on the importance of the Warehouse Receipt System (WRS). “Under the WRS a farmer would be guaranteed to get attractive price offered at the market and also avoid unnecessary losses incurred through thefts,” he said. Kagera Cooperative Union (KCU) General Manager, Edson Rugaimukamu, assured the farmers to get payment as soon as they submit their coffee to their respective Primary Cooperative Societies (PCS) to enable them pay their loans in time. According to him, a farmer was entitled to get their payment between three to ten days after delivering his coffee to the respective PCS. He directed the Secretaries of the PCS to ensure that they submit crop collection report when the farmer had brought their crop. “Complaints raised by a section of the farmers were partly due to late submission of the report by the secretaries. This delay must stop herewith,” he said. The farmers were also advised to open an account through NMB Bank, CRDB Bank or through their mobile phones to speed up their payment. KCU comprises of about 127 primary and cooperative societies mainly from Bukoba, Muleba and Missenyi districts
