THE United Nations (UN) has reached over 60,000 youth countrywide with education on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for them to become future leaders in the global agenda. That was revealed yesterday in Dar es Salaam by UN Information Centre National Information Officer, Ms Didi Nafisa adding: “We expect that once they know the global goals, they would be at a position to analyze whether they are realized after the 2030 deadline. “We target to reach out to all youth from deprived families... we encourage the youth, who benefited from this education to spread the knowledge to their fellow youths.” The event that was organized at Makongo High School in the city by the UN in collaboration with a Non-Governmental Organization ‘Great Hope’ that implements a project called ‘Uwezo’ in Dar es Salaam Region was also attended by over 100 Secondary Schools, where their students were enlightened on SDGs. The Uwezo project identifies talents of the students apart from their academic performance. Expounding, Uwezo Award Project Coordinator Noelle Mahuvi said the awareness campaign would help the students and the country in general to know what is expected from them. The awareness education to the group in the country is in line with the Youth 4 Global Goals (Youth4GG) that is an initiative aimed to activate young people to contribute towards the achievements of the SDGs, also referred to as the Global Goals and Agenda 2030. The Coordinator said that activating the youth in the drive will happen in three stages of Awareness, Understanding and Action. During the event, it was pointed out that its simple framework allows organizations from different sectors to identify entry-points in working with youth around the SDGs. The participants were also told that the core of the initiative is to drive action by young people to create a better world and move beyond the traditional role in advocacy.
