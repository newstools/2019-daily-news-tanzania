THE Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB), has cautioned the public of fraudsters who sometimes pose as government officials. Speaking to journalists in Dar es Salaam yesterday, PCCB Acting Director of Investigations, Mr Ali Mfuru, said some of them had been claiming that they come from Tanzania Intelligence Security Service (TISS). Mr Mfuru said the fraudsters have a network that includes people from different places and offices, including private and government offices. “In our investigations, we have established that some fraudsters have been tracking officers and leaders who might have been charged with several offences and ask for money pretending to be officials from PCCB or TISS, “ he noted. He said three weeks after PCCB arrested six people for allegedly soliciting a bribe, another suspect identified as Omari Chuma (55), was arrested accused of seeking a bribe from Kisarawe District Commissioner, Ms Jokate Mwegelo. “The suspect who posed as an official from TISS will be arraigned today at a resident magistrate’s court in Coast Region,” he said. Mr Mfuru didn’t disclose the amount of money the suspect sought from the DC, saying the investigation was still going on. The suspect was brought before journalists but PCCB did not allow him to answer any questions. Mr Mfuru warned fraudsters to stop the habit as PCCB was alert and had the legal authority to take action against all those involved in fraudulent activities.
