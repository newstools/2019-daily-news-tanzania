PREPARATIONS for this year’s East African School Games (FEASSA) are reportedly going on steadily here as over 3,000 athletes are expected to colour the event. The ten-day multi sports event will be staged here from August 15th to 25th this year, drawing teams from Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, Zanzibar, Sudan and the Tanzania Mainland, according to Arusha City’s sports official, Benson Maneno. Organised by the Federation of East African Secondary Schools Sports Association (FEASSSA), the event is among the biggest sporting events for students and pupils from schools in the East African Community(EAC). Already in Arusha are the education officials from five of the participating countries who are making initial arrangements and preparation for the event. According to Leonard Tadeo, the Director of Sports Development for the Department of Education Supervision in the President’s Office, Regional Administration and Local Government, Zanzibar will also be represented in the games as separate entity from the mainland. “The games will help groom upcoming sports talents in our countries and as far as Tanzania is concerned, we are sending the winning teams from the ongoing Inter-Secondary and Inter-Primary School competitions so as to guarantee better performance,” he said. On his part, Aaron Sokoni the Chairperson of the National Inter-Secondary (UMISSETA) and Inter-Primary (UMITASHUMTA), said regional winners in the ongoing secondary school games will be picked to compete in the forthcoming FEASSSA events next August. “I am taking this opportunity to encourage all schools to work hard so that they may be chosen to participate in the National finals to be held in Mtwara Region, because the first to fourth winners will be the ones to represent the country in East African games,” said Sokoni.
