UCHUMI Commercial Bank (UCB) assets value reached 34.2bn/- in December last year equivalent to 10.25 per cent compared to 31.09bn/- of the same recorded in the corresponding period 2017. This was said by the UCB Chairman Mr Wilson Ndesanjo when addressing the 13th Annual General Meeting (AGM) here, over the weekend. Mr Ndesanjo said UCB Customers deposits stood at 25.4bn/-, a growth of 11.76 per cent when compared to 22.7bn/- of the same period a year before. Loans and advances stood at 23.4bn/- an increase of 21.21 per cent when compared to 19.33bn/- recorded in the year ending December 2017. The bank’s core capital stood at 7.56bn/- which is above the statutory requirement of 2bn/- for Community Banks in Tanzania. During the year under review UCB strived to build up its share capital to reach the target of 12.5bn/- by the end of December last year as per Strategic Business Plan 2018/22. However, this target was achieved by only 60 per cent hence a deviation of 4.94bn/-which is equivalent to 40 per cent. He added that with that in mind his board was therefore urging the existing shareholders who have not increased their shares to heed their commitment to increase the share capital of UCB. Furthermore, he said as far as good governance was concerned his board recognizes that they must continue to strengthen and enhance their oversight and risk management practices. “From an operational perspective, anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) requirements are essential cogs in the banking sector,” he added. As there is strict AML and KYC guidelines that serves as an early warning system, raising early red flags and ensuring that appropriate actions are taken is important. He added, his board is committed into meeting the expectations of their regulator none but the Bank of Tanzania (BOT).
