NATIONAL golf team ladies are set to challenge skills of their opponents as the eagerly awaited East & Central Africa Regional Golf Challenge Trophy (ECARCT) makes a strong comeback this year. The biannual tournament competition that brings together region national teams is scheduled to tee off from October 22 to 25 at the Uganda Golf Club in Kampala, Uganda. Tanzania Ladies Golf Union (TLGU) vice president Anita Siwale told the ‘Daily News’ from Morogoro that the event will return this year two years since it failed to take place in 2017 in Reunion. “Uganda Ladies Golf Union (ULGU) has been given the honour to host the 2019 ECAART, the hosts has already sent invitation to us and other members of the region,” she said. Tanzania who has already won the title twice, missed the last events held in Malawi in 2013 due to several reasons. Among other reasons TLGU has no officials to organise the team, but after last year election that brought to power the former national team member Sophia Viggo and Siwale as vice president, Tanzania is now more than ready to return to the event. According to Siwale, the team will compete in a 54-hole stroke play event, playing 18 holes every day. The best 3 gross scores from each round count for each country’s score and country with the lowest gross score is declared winner of the team’s event. She said there will be also an individual trophy as well which will be awarded to the player with the lowest gross score. The event that rotates among members serves as preparation for the regional players who will compete in the All Africa Challenge Trophy (AACT). The purpose of the competition is to give opportunity to more countries to experience hosting of major tournament and prepare their teams for All Africa Challenge Trophy (AACT).
