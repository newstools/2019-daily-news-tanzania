IT will be Manvir Baryan and his powerful machine, Skoda Fabia to beat at Pearl of Africa Rally of Uganda, and Tanzanian crew Dharam Pandya hopes to take over the reign in his ultra-fast Subaru GBV. The youthful Kenyan, Baryan is engaged in defending the African Rally Championship title he won last year after emerging the top wheeler of the continent. Mzizima Motor Sports Club driver Dharam Pandya, who is the only Tanzanian in the rally that revs off early next month in Uganda, is keen to end the dominance of Baryan and his magic Skoda Fabia. Both Pandya and his navigator Matovu are keen to conquer Pearl of Africa Rally which takes place on August 2nd and 3rd in Uganda. The two-day rally that draws top drivers from Africa, serves as the fifth round of Africa Rally Championship (ARC). Pandya is one of the fifty crews who have been confirmed for the two-day Pearl of Africa Rally whose main venues are Busiika and Kayunga districts. Pandya who will be driving his ultra-modern Subaru GBV 15, said he is ready for a fierce run against Africaâ€™s top drivers, most of them from Uganda, Kenya, Zambia, Rwanda and Zimbabwe. Pandya banks on Matovu to conquer the Ugandan round of Africa Rally Championship since he knows the country and its routes very well.
