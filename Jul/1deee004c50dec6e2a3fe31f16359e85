THE government has urged spices and seaweed growers to use modern farming technology to add value to their produce and get a good market locally and internationally. Zanzibar Minister for Industries Amina Salum Ali (pictured)said yesterday that spices were in high demand in and outside the country, so citizens should use such an opportunity to improve their products. She said most of the spices and seaweed products produced in the country were not up to standard, a situation that denied them access to the international market. Ms Ali was speaking during a business-to-business forum organised especially for spices and seaweed growers held at the ongoing 43rd Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair along Kilwa Road. She said spices and seaweed farming was beneficial to farmers, urging them to use the opportunity by producing quality products. The minister said spices producers should be innovative so that they could improve the quality of their products and packaging to sell them in and outside the country. She commended Tantrade for continuing marketing such crops in and outside the country so that they could have access to the international market. She, however, said high production cost had been an obstacle to getting the reliable market for the products. “I advise Tantrade to empower producers so that they can attain the standards in their production which would help them resolve various challenges.” Speaking earlier, Tantrade Director Edwin Rutageruka said there were various production opportunities for spices products calling upon producers to cooperate with the authority to improve their production. He accused some businesspeople, who pledged to supply good quality spices, while knowing that they couldn’t do so. One participant, Mr Mengi Sume called upon Tanzanians to utilise the opportunity in cinnamon market by producing more for local and international markets.
