ECONOMIC growth for East African Community member states declined in the first quarter of this year as activity in major drivers slowed down, according to a Tanzania’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) report. Rwanda topped other countries in the EAC region with a growth rate of 8.4 per cent in the first quarter which is, however, down from 10.4 per cent in 2018 representing a slowdown of 2.0 percentage points. Agriculture services and the industry sectors were the main drivers of growth in Rwanda. Tanzania, the second largest economy in the EAC region, recorded a 6.6 per cent growth in the first quarter of 2019 from 7.5 per cent in the corresponding period last year as construction and manufacturing activities declined. The Tanzania’s bureau of statistics said the construction sector, the biggest driver of growth in Tanzania recorded a growth rate of 13.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2019, down from 15.6 per cent in the corresponding quarter of 2018. The manufacturing sector recorded a growth of 4.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 5.3 per cent in the similar quarter of the year 2018, it said. Information and communication activities recorded a growth rate of 9.6 per cent in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 14.9 per cent in the corresponding quarter of 2018. Kenya grew down by 5.6 per cent in the first quarter of 2019 compared to a growth rate of 6.5 per cent recorded in the first quarter of 2018 equivalent to slowdown of 0.9 percentage points. According to Kenya’s bureau of statistics, economic growth slowed in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period last year due to dry weather which curbed the farming sector following delay in the onset of long rains. Uganda’s economy recorded a growth rate of 5.6 per cent compared to a growth rate of 6.9 per cent in 2018 equivalent to a slowdown of 1.3 percentage points. “During the period, the EAC countries that have already released the first quarter GDP report recorded a lower growth rates in the first quarter of 2019 than growth rates in first quarter of 2018,” the Tanzania NBS report says. The GDP estimates for Burundi and South Sudan have not yet released. However, despite the slowdown, economic growth in East Africa is soaring ahead of other regions on the continent at close to 7.0 per cent, according to the East African Development Bank. The bank said economic growth across Eastern Africa will remain at a robust 5.9 per cent in 2019, making it a promising investment and manufacturing destination. East Africa is leading the continent with GDP growth estimated at 5.7 per cent in 2018, followed by North Africa at 4.9 per cent, West Africa at 3.3 per cent, Central Africa at 2.2 per cent and Southern Africa at 1.2 per cent. GDP growth for the continent is forecast to accelerate to 4.0 per cent this year, up from an estimated 3.5 per cent in 2018, making it the fastest-growing region in the world after Asia, according to the African Development Bank. And, that’s despite Nigeria and South Africa, which make up almost half of the continent’s GDP, “pulling down Africa’s average growth,” as the Abidjan-based lender said in its April economic outlook report. Nigeria’s GDP will expand by 2.3 per cent in 2019, which is below the rate of population growth, as the government struggles to reduce the nation’s oil dependence and attract foreign investment. South Africa’s expansion will be even slower, at 1.7 per cent, as the continent’s most-industrialized economy battles to recover from last year’s recession.
