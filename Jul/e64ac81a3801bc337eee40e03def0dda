THE Ministry of Finance and Planning has said over two-third of public institutions are connected to Government e-Payment Gateway (GePG) and pushed up revenue collection. The Treasury said some 465 out of 667 public institutions are now collecting revenues through GePG infrastructure. Ministry of Finance, Director of Financial Information Systems Management Mr John Sausi said at the ongoing 43rd Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair that almost all public institutions connected to the system have registered revenue collection increased. “The GePG has helped plugging all revenue leakages that once cause massive losses to the government,” Mr Sausi said. He gave an example of Weights and Measures Agency (WMA) and Tanzania Forest Services Agency (TFS) which have managed to post outstanding performances after being connected to GePG while increasing transparency. WMA doubled their collection immediately after being connected to the government e-payment. The Agency collected 2.5bn/- in 2017/18 compared to 1.02bn/- before linked to the system. The Tanzania Forest Services Agency (TFS) also increased revenue collection to 115bn/- 2017/18 up from 95bn/- before connected to GePG. The system that started operations two years ago also has increased transparency in collections and enabled the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) to collect accurate revenue from various sources. He said the process of connecting the remaining government institutions, mostly district hospitals, was progressing well and expected to be hooked soon into the system.
