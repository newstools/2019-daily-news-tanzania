FIRST Instance Division of the East African Court of Justice (EACJ) has issued the Inter- University Council of East Africa (IUCEA) with an interim order to restrain from recruiting Chief Research and an Innovation Coordination Officer, until the case is determined. The court maintained that it was satisfied that the application had been conceded by the Council by it supporting the affidavit in reply, and hence must suspend the recruitment process, pending its determination. In a judgment delivered by Lady Justice, Monica Mugenyi last Friday, the Regional Court did not subscribe to Counsel to the Community, Dr Anthony Kafumbe’s contention during the hearing of the Application, arguing that it was moot. Paragraphs 11 and 12 of the Council’s affidavit in the sitting of the 25th Executive Committee of IUCEA was informed by IUCEA Secretariat that, following the advice from the Counsel to the Community, the recruitment process in respect to the position of Chief Research and Innovation Officer had been halted pending settlement of the matter at the EACJ. “That IUCEA Secretariat has fully complied with the directive of the Executive Committee to halt the recruitment process and that, no shortlisting or interviewing process has been carried out in regard to filling the position of the Chief Research and Innovation Coordination Officer till to date,” read part of the affidavit.
