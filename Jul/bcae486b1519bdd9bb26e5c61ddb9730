THE government through Tanzania Forest Services Agency (TFS) has launched patrolling boats in the Indian Ocean to protect mangrove forests in the Coast and Tanzania mainland. Deputy Minister for Tourism and Natural Resources Constantine Kanyasu launched the two boats worth 200m/- each in Dar es Salaam over the weekend, directing TFS to use the boats in the intended activities for better results towards protection of mangrove forests in the country. He told the agency to put in place creative ways that will ensure the boats are strictly used in patrolling the mangrove forest areas to curb illegal harvests, illegal transportation of timbers through the ocean outside the country and any other threats on the forests. He said the boats will be used for other related activities, including matters pertaining to researches, searching on oil and gas in the areas. Mr Kanyasu commended TFS for building up the boats that will help in protecting the country’s mangrove trees and other forests, adding that TFS for the last five years has been in the forefront in protecting the forests and the environment. “I sincerely take this opportunity to commend TFS for the efforts they have intensified in the protection of forests, including the mangrove trees,” he said, adding their efforts have helped in controlling the speed of illegal harvesting of trees and other threats. Mr Kanyasu however asked the agency to keep the pace and come up with effective ways that will curb degradation of forests in the country. TFS Executive Director Professor Anthony Silayo said the boats have been established to help in curbing threats imposed on mangrove forests in the coast . He said the mangrove forests along the coast face many challenges, including the illegal harvest of trees and farming activities
