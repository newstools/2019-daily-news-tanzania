LETSHEGO Bank has encouraged and pushed for closer working relationship with its customers as part of its strategy to helping clients run profitably. The Chief Executive Officer, Mr Thabit Ndilahomba said the bank remains committed to serving the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) as part of a broad-based initiative to drive financial inclusion and package flexibility to help businesses grow. “Economic uncertainties have a potential to create headwinds, however, we remain committed to reviewing our current solutions to build more reliable solutions,” he explained. The CEO and his Head of Financial Inclusion, Mr Solomon Haule travelled to Mwanza, to host an SME workshop organised by Letshego. The workshop enabled the senior Letshego team to meet and get to know valued SME customers on a more personal basis, reiterating the Letshego Bank’s continued support, even in hard times. “Letshego Bank is committed to making a difference in the lives of individuals and as a valued partner, remains steadfast in supporting its customers, in up or downtimes, promoting sustainable business practices,” he said further. Longest-serving customer, Mr Patrick Kambarage, commenting on the bank’s initiatives on improving people’s lives, said: “Mtaji Nyumba loan from Letshego has helped me to renovate my house and start the construction of a storage facility for my business too”.

They include Botswana, Eswatini, (formerly Swaziland), Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. The Group has a net worth of more than 2.3 tri/=.
