ECONOMIC growth slowed to 6.6 per cent in the first quarter of 2019 from 7.5 per cent in the corresponding period last year as construction and manufacturing activities declined, the National Bureau of Statistics said. The bureau said the construction sector, the biggest driver of growth, recorded a growth rate of 13.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2019, down from 15.6 per cent in the corresponding quarter of 2018. The manufacturing sector recorded a growth of 4.8 per cent in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 5.3 per cent in the similar quarter of the year 2018, it said. Information and communication activities recorded a growth rate of 9.6 percent in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 14.9 per cent in the corresponding quarter of 2018. However, growth in the mining sector, which has been the target of repeated government interventions, rebounded to 10.0 per cent from a 5.7 per cent decline during the same period in 2018. The growth in the mining sector was mainly due to an increase in production of gold, coal, and diamonds. Tanzania is Africa’s fourthlargest gold producer. Agriculture, which accounts for about a third of economic activities, also slowed in the first quarter of this year, with crop production growing 6.0 per cent compared to 8.9 per cent in the same period last year, the statistics bureau said. Growth rate in livestock activities remained at 4.9 per cent in the first quarter of 2019 similar to the first quarter of 2018. However, there was a slight drop in the forestry activities recorded a growth rate of 4.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 4.3 per cent registered in the similar quarter of 2018. The economy grew 7 per cent last year, according to the government which has forecast 7.1 per cent growth in 2019. Earlier this month, however, the World Bank released its own estimates that said Tanzania’s economy grew 5.2 per cent in 2018. Following the World Bank report, the NBS Director General, Dr Albina Chuwa said the differences might be in the methodologies used. She told the ‘Daily News’ that they would meet next month with the World Bank and Bank of Tanzania officials to look at the differences.
