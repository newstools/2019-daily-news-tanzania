PRIME Minister Kassim Majaliwa is expected to grace the launch of the national voters electoral register update in Moshi, Kilimanjaro region on July 18, this year. Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office, Parliamentary affairs, Labour, Employment, Youth and People with Disabilities Jenista Mhagama made the news when she visited and inspected the area where the launch will take place at the Nelson Mandela grounds at Bomambuzi area within the municipality. “This exercise will focus on improving the National Voters Electoral register in accordance with the law and as the constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania directs,” she said. Minister Mhagama further said that the procedure was common because of the law that requires the National Electoral Commission (NEC) to improve the voters’ electoral register as part of its duties. “The law clearly states that NEC has to update the voter register two times before the new general elections, the exercise, which the prime minister will launch on July 18, this year, in adherence to the National Elections Act,” she said. NEC Chairman Judge Semistocles Kaijage said the exercise will involve those who did not get chance to register themselves as voters due to different reasons, including age below the required 18 years. “This exercise will involve those who will be registering themselves for the first time after attaining the age of 18 years since their birth,” he said. He added, “Others will be those who were registered in the past and will like to verify their voting cards, those who would like to change their information due to different reasons and those who have changed their areas of residence; the exercise will also involve the removal of names of the dead.” He further said the exercise will also provide an opportunity for those who didn’t register themselves in the past.
