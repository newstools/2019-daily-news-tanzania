THE Tanzania Agricultural Development Bank (TADB) has promised to give credit to the coffee processing Tanganyika Instant Coffee Company (Tanica) so that the latter can produce competitive coffee in and outside the country. Speaking during a tour of Kagera Region yesterday, TADB Managing Director Japhet Justine said the bank would empower the factory to make it process well coffee because the factory also guaranteed coffee growers a ready market. The plant was established in 1963. “We have every reason to support this factory so that it can add value to Tanzanian coffee and make it competitive in and outside the country. Besides, strong Tanica offers farmers a ready market, make more people see sense in growing coffee. In the final analysis the internal market will develop, creating jobs for many people,” he explained. He said in the last season their bank offered 30bn/- to the region to buy coffee from growers, adding that the successful experience gained justified priority in empowering Tanica so that coffee growing did not only create jobs, but also contributed to national efforts to make Tanzania a middle-income and industrialised economy by 2025. Kagera Regional Commissioner Bri-Gen Marco Gaguti thanked the bank for the money it offered in the last season, saying coffee growing and marketing in the region had steadily improved because of the bank’s support. “We will cooperate with the bank in modernising this factory because for us that kind of support strengthens our regional economy and creates jobs for young people,” the RC said.
