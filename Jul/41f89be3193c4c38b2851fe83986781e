POLICE in Dar es Salaam have confirmed that journalist Erick Kabendera has been arrested for interrogations over his citizenship and he was not kidnapped as rumours spread in social media imply. The Dar es Salaam Special Zone Police Commander, Mr Lazaro Mambosasa, said Kabendera was arrested on July 29 after ignoring summons that needed him to report to the police for interrogations. “We are holding Kabendera for interrogation over his citizenship. In the first place, he ignored the police order and that is why we compelled him to report to the police station,” he explained. Commander Mambosasa said the police force was investigating the matter in collaboration with the Immigration Department and that further legal actions would be taken after the investigations. He advised members of the public to comply with the country’s laws regardless their tittles or occupations because it is unlawful. Meanwhile, a young man identified as Daud Iddi (23) has been arrested in Dar es Salaam for pretending to be an Assistant Inspector of the Police Force. According to Commander Mambosasa, the suspect, a resident of Segerea area, Ilala Municpality in Dar es Salaam, was allegedly found in possession of different uniforms of the police force, a pair of handcuffs, a radio call and separate ranks of the police. Preliminary investigations had discovered that the suspect impersonated as a police officer who had initially been trained at Mafinga National Service (JKT), Mufindi District in Iringa Region in 2006. “JKT soldiers at Mlalakuwa Camp doubted him when he was forcing low-ranking police officers to salute him and soldiers reported him to the police,” he explained. Commander Mambosasa added the suspect would be taken to court after the completion of investigations.
