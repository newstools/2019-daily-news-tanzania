DEVELOPMENT of football from the foundation level has been described as the main catalyst which can help a lot to fast track growth of the sport in the world. This was said yesterday by Magnet Youth Sports Organisation (MYSO) Chairman Tuntufye Mwambusi in Dar es Salaam, during a press briefing ahead of the upcoming 2019 Norway Cup. Tanzania will be represented by four teams from MYSO with players ranging from the Under-11, U- 12 and U-15. They will fly high the national flag in the biggest youth world football competition set to begin from July 14 to 21st this year. “At MYSO, we are on the front line assisting the government in its effort to develop football from the grassroot level. This is the only long lasting solution, which can help a lot to improve football standard in the country,” Mwambusi said. He added that by competing in such big event, it is a good testimony that they want to see great improvement among youth players, who will later take up responsibilities in the senior national team, Taifa Stars. Moreover, the chairman thanked big support they receive from parents and guardians of the young players saying they have been cooperative in many occasions. On his part, the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) Director of Finance and Administration Cornel Barnabas hailed MYSO for taking a big step in promoting youth football development. “Let me assure you that TFF will be with you along the way. It is our hope that you will represent us positively during the forthcoming Norway Cup,” he said. The Norway Cup is the world’s largest youth soccer tournament. In 2016 there were 2199 teams taking part. This six-day festival of soccer has been an annual event since 1972.
