DODOMA Regional Commissioner (RC), Dr Binilith Mahenge has directed authorities under his jurisdiction to develop a system that will promote the initiation of business project funds targeting the youth, women and people with disabilities. Dr Mahenge gave the directive during his recent visit to Chamwino District, noting that the funds earmarked by councils should facilitate the setting up business projects in order to create employment opportunities. “The ten per cent budget set aside for youth and women development funds should now promote projects establishment in order to create more employment opportunities,” said the RC while addressing a Chamwino District Council meeting. Dr Mahenge said the councils should design a system that would encourage youth and women groups to set up business projects, saying under the current scheme the beneficiaries receive loans for establishment of small businesses. “I direct all councils in Dodoma to develop a system that will encourage beneficiaries of the youth and women development fund to set up business projects centred on aspects like poultry and livestock keeping, “ said the RC.
