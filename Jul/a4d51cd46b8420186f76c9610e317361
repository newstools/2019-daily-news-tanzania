FARMERS in the country will use mobile phone application to verify the quality of seeds to avoid buying counterfeit or substandard goods. The app jointly developed by TTCL Corporation and Tanzania Official Seeds Certification Institute (TOSCI), will enable farmers to countercheck if seeds are certified by TOSCI. Y esterday, the two, TOSCI— responsible for inspecting seeds— and TTCL, state owned telco, inked the agreement in Dar es Salaam that pave way for farmers to verify quality. Speaking during the pact signing event in Dar es Salaam, TTCL’s Managing Director, Mr Waziri Kindamba said they aimed at easing the way farmers’ could verifying quality of seeds before purchasing. “This is part of fulfilling President John Magufuli’s wish that TTCL come up with a simple way of increasing agricultural production,” Mr Kindamba said. He said TTCL has a role to support farmers who account for more than 75 per cent of the population. The new verification app is suitable for any mobile phone and farmers only need to scratch a voucher number and send it to a specified number through text message or scan the QR code for those with smartphones. TTCL said the verification message will be sent instantly and free of charge. TOSCI’s Director General, Mr Patrick Ngwediagi said that the new system was part of the efforts to combat counterfeit and substandard seeds filtering into the market. He urged farmers to use the app to shun out corrupt seed dealers who capitalized on the poor verification system to maximise their returns at the expenses of farmers. He advised farmers to capitalize on the next Nane Nane exhibition where more knowledge on how to use the mobile telephone service to verify seeds will be widely shed light on.
