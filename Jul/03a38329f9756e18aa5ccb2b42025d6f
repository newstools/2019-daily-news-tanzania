The national task force and police officers arrested two men with five elephant tusks at Ng’ereng’ere village on July 18 this year, Regional Police Commander (RPC) for Tarime/ Rorya Special Zone Senior Assistant Commissioner of Police Henry Mwaibambe said. He named the suspects as Mseti Daniel (27) a resident of Nyabitocho village and Peter Moina (25) a resident of Ng’ereng’ere village in Mara region’s Tarime District. “The suspects were found hiding five elephant tusks with 24.55 kilogrammes in a jute bag,” RPC Mwaibambe told reporters in his office. “During the arrest, the suspects were found transporting the elephant tusks using motorbike with registration number MCBQB, Sanlg type”, the regional police chief said. Last Friday, the suspects were taken to court in Tarime where they were charged with economic sabotage, he said. Security personnel are searching for more suspects in connection with the ivory trade in the area. The RPC asked members of public to continue providing tips that will help to eliminate ivory trade in the district whose some villages border Serengeti National Park.
