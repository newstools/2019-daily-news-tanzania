UNIVERSITY graduates, who specialised in petroleum and gas in the country, have been urged to be tolerant over employment as the public and private sectors are still reviewing the policy governing investment in the energy sector. Minister for Energy, Dr Medard Kalemani, clarified this in Dar es Salaam yesterday on the sidelines of the 6th liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) summit. He spoke in response to enquiries made by some graduates in the sector, who wanted to know their employment fate. “The government is aware of students pursuing their studies in petroleum and gas in the country, but currently employment opportunities are yet to be announced because the public and private sector are still reviewing the policy governing the energy sector,” he said. Dr Kalemani also clarified that the next step after the review stage would be real operations and “here is when the public and private sectors will start calling for employment applications.” “I encourage graduates in this specialisation to remain calm, while the government makes the review after which the government will announce employment opportunities,” added Dr Kalemani. A graduate in Bachelor of Science in Petroleum and Gas from the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM), Mr Joseph Mloka, asked the minister about their fate after they completed their studies, but couldn’t be employed in the public sector. The LPG summit was attended by representatives from more than 54 countries from Africa, Europe and Asia and it comprised exhibitions from various manufacturing and distribution companies of LPG, including gas cylinders, services and gas accessories.
