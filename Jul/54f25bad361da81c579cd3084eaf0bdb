PRESIDENT Ali Mohamed Shein flew out of the country on Saturday, a statement from the Isles State House said without disclosing details about the visit. “Dr Shein will be in UK for three weeks on a special visit,” the statement read in part, adding that he was accompanied by his wife Ms Mwanamwema Shein, and some of his assistants. He was seen off from Zanzibar’s Abeid Amani Karume International Airport (AAKIA) by several government leaders led by the second Vice President Ambassador Seif Ali Iddi. According to the State House statement and press release, before Dr Shein left the country, he sent a message of condolence to the leader of Sharjah Sheikh Sultan Mohammad Al Qasimi following the death of his son (named Sheikh Khalid bin Sultan bin Mohammad Al Qasimi) in London last Monday. In another development, President Shein also sent a message of congratulations to Comoro President Azali Assoumani and the President of Malawi, Arthur Peter Mutharika as they celebrate their countries independence anniversaries, 44 years and 55 years respectively.
