THE number of women without food in Mpwapwa District, Dodoma Region, is increasingly becoming a concern after a recent quarterly nutrition status report on the district shows “one in every five people are malnourished.” The report, which also surveyed mothers, infants and children’s nutrition and malnutrition, shows that of 70,117 under five children, 37 percent (25,943 children), are stunted. About 8,414 other children are underweight, while only 701 are recorded to have wasting. According to a 2018/19-report released by district nutritionist Renatus Komba, 21,035 children are anaemic. Malnutrition is a growing health problem among children in developing countries. Infants and children are the most vulnerable to malnutrition due to their high nutritional requirements for growth and development. The World Health Organisation (WHO), and health experts refer malnutrition not only to deficiency, but also to excess or imbalance in the intake of calories, proteins and/or other nutrients. Globally, it is estimated that 54 per cent of child mortality is a result of malnutrition.
