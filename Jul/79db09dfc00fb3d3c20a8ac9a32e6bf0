DEPUTY Permanent Secretary in the President’s Office (Regional Administration and Local Government), Mr Tixon Nzunda, has called on the task force reviewing the criminal justice system to consider human rights promotion in the new system. The criminal justice system is a system of law enforcement that is directly involved in apprehending, prosecuting, defending, sentencing, and punishing those who are suspected or convicted of criminal offenses. Addressing a criminal justice task force here yesterday, Mr Nzunda pointed out that the new criminal justice system review should consider human rights promotion in order to come up with a system that will improve justice in the country. “Human rights promotion should be the guidance while reviewing the criminal justice system in order to get the system that promotes justice,” said the deputy permanent secretary while speaking to the task force. Mr Nzunda said the government was optimistic that the review would facilitate improvement and protection of human rights in the country, saying the new system should consider people’s interests first. He said the government is looking forward to a system that will curb corruption. Adding that it should address misunderstandings between different institutions.
