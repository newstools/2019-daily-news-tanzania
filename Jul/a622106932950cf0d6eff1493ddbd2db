CONTAINERS of sheet piles, which President John Magufuli directed to be released and deployed to Mwanza South Port for the construction of a slipway, have started arriving at the work site. All 56 containers were expected to arrive by yesterday, but as we went to press only 10 of them had arrived and offloading had started ready for the work as directed by the President, when he visited the area early this week. The remaining 46 containers are expected to arrive anytime by today morning. Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communications (Transport), Dr Leonard Chamuriho, told ‘Sunday News’ at the construction site yesterday that the containers were released on time as soon as the President gave the directive on Tuesday. However, he said the release of the consignment coincided with the clearance of the Value Added Tax (VAT) following tax exemption issued by the Treasury on the same earlier. “Initially, the contractor was already granted tax clearance and was only supposed to attach a clearance document for the consignment to be released. So, apart from the President’s directive, the release was made as soon as the document was submitted,” he noted. The sheet piles will be used for the construction of the slipway at Mwanza South Port, which is crucial for the construction of ships that will resume transportation services in Lake Victoria plying between Mwanza, Jinja in Uganda, Kisumu in Kenya and Bukoba Port. Dr Chamuriho said all was set for the gigantic work at the site, where grand construction works worth 152bn/- were slowly, but surely gaining momentum, following the arrival of the crucial equipment mostly from South Korea. Marine Services Company Ltd (MSCL) General Manager Erick Benedict said all was in order and the ships - MV Victoria and Mv Butiama - would be handed over on time by March next year and the new ship by September next year.
