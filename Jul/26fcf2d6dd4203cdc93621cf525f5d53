THE National Environment Management Council (NEMC), has unveiled its plan to recruit temporary workers at all the zones countrywide in a move aimed at boosting the capacity to inspect new projects and industries. NEMC Director General, Dr Samuel Gwamaka said here during his tour of southern zone covering the regions of Lindi, Mtwara and Ruvuma set to inspect projects and meeting environmental officers to discuss on challenges facing them in implementing environmental laws. He said that the council will recruit officers on temporary arrangement so that inspection process can be accomplished on time. “There is an increase of factories and projects in various places in the country, some of which are not known by NEMC, so we have decided that it is high time we embark on thorough inspection to make sure that all the projects are existing lawfully,” he said. Dr Gwamaka pointed out that it is important to register projects so that the Council can do Environment Impact Assessment (EIA), adding that it was the only way to ensure that project owners are abiding by environmental laws. “This move will greatly help in boosting the Council’s revenue collection through annual charges, and this can only be possible after we have registered all the projects,” he said.
