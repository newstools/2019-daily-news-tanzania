The 13th Annual Cashiew Conference and Expo is set to take place between November 7-9, 2019 in Dar es Salaam, the African Cashiew Alliance (ACA) has revealed. The conference will bring together over 500 cashew stakeholders from across the world to analyze the recent market dynamics. Speaking at a press conference held in Dar es Salaam on Tuesday, the ACA’s Executive Director Ernest Mintah said the conference will also look at response by governments and value chain actors and role played by both public and private sector in addressing emerging issues. For his part, the Acting Executive Director for Tanzania Fertilizer Regulatory Authority (TFRA) Dr Steven Ngaillo said this would be an opportunity to portray the industry’s opportunities available in the country. “We want to attract investors to invest in building industries for processing cashews locally considering that only five percent of the cross is peeled in African local industries,” he added. The theme of the conference is ‘Fostering Synergies, Influencing Market Dynamics’.
