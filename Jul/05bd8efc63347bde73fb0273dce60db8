THE United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has said that the global increase in refugees fleeing their country due to war requires global intervention to provide lasting solutions to the root causes. The observation was made recently in Kasulu District, Kigoma Region by UNHCR Resident Representative in Tanzania, Ms Chansa Kapaya in their delegation, while handing over Lecture Theater worth 250m/- to the Tanzania government. She said that statistics released by the UNHCR Global trends report in June 2019, estimate that a total of 75 million people around the world are fleeing war from their countries to seek refuge and asylum in other countries. Ms Kapaya noted that a large proportion of the refugees and asylum seekers have lived more than six to 20 years in their neighbouring countries in Camps like Nyarugusu in Kasulu District in the region, where Tanzania currently host them mostly from Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). “The majority of the refugees from different parts of the world, who may include Tanzanians want to return home one day soon, but it requires global debate and political will to ensure fighting in different countries ceases quickly to allow them and asylum seekers to return as soon as possible and live peacefully,” said the UNHCR representative. Speaking shortly after receiving the building, the Acting Commissioner for Education from Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Dr Lwabene Mutahaba, said that despite the increase of refugees globally, Tanzania will continue to receive and serve them, because of the compassionate and human heart the country has and enable it serve them in the Great Lakes region for 20 years now. Dr Lwabene, who represented the Permanent Secretary (PS) in the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Dr Leonald Akwilapo, said that conflict resolution in many countries requires collective dialogue, where Tanzania is renowned for protecting refugees and asylum-seekers. He said it is only dialogue that would restore peace in war-troubled areas. On her side, Kasulu Teachers College Vice Principal, Ms Agnes Roki thanked the UNHCR for the construction of the building, saying it would help to improve teaching and learning activities there, adding: “The Lecture Hall will enable a large number of students to study simultaneously topics and subjects, they are supposed to get at the same time.”
