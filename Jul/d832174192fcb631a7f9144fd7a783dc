A Chinese construction and engineering firm, Beijing Construction Engineering Group (BCEG), has refuted claims that the construction of Zanzibar International Airport Terminal II Project is not up to international standards. A section of lawmakers expressed concern over the standard of the new terminal, but BCEG, which implements the project, has refuted the claims in a press release. “Zanzibar International Airport Terminal II Project is constructed in accordance with contractual conditions and terms to comply with all Tanzanian laws and regulations,” BCEG said in a statement yesterday. “The completed terminal building work involves various security tests, all of which had qualified certificates from third party laboratories recognised by the Tanzanian government,” it added. The Chinese firm said part of the apron construction was completed and had been handed over to the government and the company had received a handover certificate. “The design, construction, materials, equipment selection and material acceptance on site were all supervised by both the employer and consultant,” BCEG says further in its statement, noting that the supervision procedure agreed in the contract was met. The firm threatens to pursue legal action against individuals, who intentionally defame BCEG’s reputation and spread rumours to the media and members of the public, which might cause a negative impact on BCEG and its workers. While refuting the claims, BCEG vows to maintain quality services for its projects in the country. “BCEG will continue providing high quality services to the government and the people of Tanzania, complete Zanzibar International Airport Terminal II Project and contribute to the infrastructural development of Zanzibar and China-Tanzania friendship,” the statement states.
