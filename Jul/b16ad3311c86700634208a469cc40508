TRANSFORMATION of Tanzania National Parks (TANAPA) into a paramilitary system is showing positive results and would eliminate poaching in the country’s reserves. TANAPA Conservation Commissioner (CC), Dr Allan Kijazi made the observation in Mwanza recently, while addressing editors and some other journalists in a workshop. “A great work has been done to stop poaching in many areas and we are on the right track,” he further said. The Commissioner said that besides curbing poaching, the paramilitary system would enhance further discipline amongst TANAPA officials at workplaces. The system that is called Jeshi Usu in Kiswahili was launched by Vice President Mama Samia Suluhu Hassan last year in Serengeti. It also involves other wildlife conservation institutions within the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism. Reached for a comment, the Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism Dr Hamis Kigwangalla commended TANAPA and other related officials working hard to protect the country’s natural resources. Dr Kigwangalla said Tanzania is blessed with various natural resources including the world’s famous Serengeti National Park that is attracting thousands of tourists from different parts of the world, and hence ought to be conserved. Besides creating local job opportunities, the sector leads in generating foreign currency for the national development. “Tourism sector will continue to grow and the sector has significant contribution into the country’s economy,” added Dr Kigwangalla, while officially opening the workshop.
