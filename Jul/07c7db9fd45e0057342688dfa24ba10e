TANZANIA Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO), says there will be electric service disruptions today in areas connected with Mpwapwa feeder in Dodoma between the hours of 9:00 am-12:00 pm. Dodoma Regional Manager for TANESCO, Engineer, Zakayo Temu, said in a statement issued here yesterday that the three hour power outage will facilitate power connectivity to new customers in Ihumwa suburb of Dodoma City. “The company wishes to apologize to customers for the inconvenience experienced during the power outage,” reads part of the statement which was issued by the Communication Unit of Tanesco at Dodoma Regional Office. Areas to be affected include Nzuguni, Nanenane, Ihumwa, Hombolo, Makulu, Mahomanyika, Mtumba and the districts of Mpwapwa, Kongwa, Gairo in Morogoro as well as some areas in Chamwino District. Meanwhile, Deputy Energy Minister Subira Mgalu has directed contractors undertaking Rural Energy Agency (REA), projects not to skip any hamlet in power supply, in order to achieve the government’s goal of lighting all households in rural areas. Ms Mgalu issued the directive at a recent event to launch an electricity supply facility to the Chibwegere fishing village in Mpwapwa District over the weekend, saying skipping any hamlet in power supply will weaken the government’s efforts in power supply.
