REGISTRATION, Insolvency and Trusteeship Agency (RITA) has verified 92,324 birth certificates of applicants for loans from the Higher Education Students Loans Board (HESLB) in the past three months. Out of all verified certificates, 2,203 were found with some shortfalls, according to a statement released to the media on Monday. RITA Marketing and Communications Manager Josephat Kimaro said owners of the faulty certificates have been told to fix the weaknesses or apply for the genuine documents. The verification of birth certificates at RITA started over three months ago after the agency established a special window for the purpose. The verification helps HESLB to provide loans to the deserved.
