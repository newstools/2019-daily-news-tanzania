THE government has expressed its commitment to cooperate with other African countries in promoting security in the Indian Ocean to safeguard transportation and fishing activities to promote economic growth. One of the commitments was to embark on building capacity for the Dar es Salaam Maritime institute (DMI), to offer short and long courses on matters relating to sea security to local seafarers as a way of promoting blue economy. This was said by the Deputy Minister of Works, Transport and Communications, Elias Kwandikwa when he officiated over the Africa Sea Day which took place at the DMI premises. "The government will do everything possible to make use of opportunities in the maritime sector like it has already done in the aviation sector so as to promote the economy and create more job opportunities, and one of the ways is by using the DMI," he said. Kwandikwa who was speaking during the Sea Day which commemorated on July 25 every year, said that apart from being threaten by piracy, fishing activities in the country's 1440 kilometer long coastline of the Indian Ocean were dominated by some foreign fishers who have capital of owning modern ships which can conduct deep water fishing with qualified personnel, something which the country lacked due to higher expenses involved. In mitigating the challenges, Mr Kwandikwa said that the government is building the capacity for the DMI to offer urgently needed courses locally so that more African and Tanzanian seafarers can access the trainings at affordable costs. Clarifying on the trainings which will make seafarers in the country more competent, the Managing Director of the Tanzania Shipping Agencies Cooperation (TASAC), Mr Emanuel Ndomba highlighted the courses which include the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch keeping for Seafarers (STCW), which sets qualification standards for masters, officers and personnel on seagoing ships. Ndomba mentioned other possible courses to be the Personal Safety & Social Responsibility (PSSR), and the offshore survival training course which are vital for preparing Tanzanians to get jobs at the newly discovered gas reserves in the southern regions of LindiÂ and Mtwara. Currently, a single course may cost up to 6000 US dollars and is offered abroad, a situation which the TASAC Managing Director described as an opportunity of creating more jobs by local trainers at DMI, and seafarers who are being employed in different shipping areas in the country and beyond.
