TANZANIA Posts Corporation’s (TPC) managers and heads of departments were yesterday warned against giving favours to themselves through borrowing the corporation money. Works, Transport and Communications Minister Engineer Isack Kamwelwe ordered the employees to immediately stop the unbecoming habit, further burning TPC drivers from carrying passengers and illegal cargo in the public vehicles. Eng Kamwelwe issued the directive here while opening the six-day training for the corporation’s managers and heads of departments to robustly transform the postal firm. The minister said by lending themselves money from the state owned firm, they were discouraging their subordinates, adding that it was equally not allowed to borrow the public money. Eng Kamwelwe issued a seven-day ultimatum to TPC board to give him a list of all managers and heads of department who took loans from the corporation. “From today onwards, I don’t want to see anyone of you taking money from the corporation in loans and within seven days I want to have the list of all people who owe us money,’’ he added. He directed the management and the board to ensure that all revenues within the corporation were collected electronically to make it easy for Postal Master General to identify those taking advantage of the country’s money.
