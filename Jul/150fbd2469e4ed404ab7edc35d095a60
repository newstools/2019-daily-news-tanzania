THE United Bank for Africa (UBA), Tanzania has said it remains committed to supporting the Rufiji Hydropower Project as it seeks to play a role in the government’s goal of generating enough electricity vital for industrialisation. UBA Tanzania is one of the financial entities that are engaged in issuing guarantees to the ongoing construction of the 2.95 billion US dollars (6.6/-trillion) Rufiji Hydropower Project, which, upon completion, will add 2,100 Megawatts to the national power grid. So far, UBA Tanzania and CRDB Bank Tanzania have already provided Advanced Payment Guarantees (APG), to the tune of $516 million to JV partners (Arab Contractors and Elsewedy Electric of Egypt), on the back of counter guarantee provided by Africa Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), of Egypt for the project. That was followed disbursement of $309 million of the foreign component of the APG by Tanzania Electric Supply Company (Tanesco). Speaking in Dar es Salaam over the weekend, the UBA Tanzania managing director, Mr Usman Isiaka commended Tanesco for move, saying his bank was committed to ensuring that the project materializes so it can stimulate industrialization. “In partnership with our partners in the project, we will continue issuing bank guarantees as required,” he told Isiaka said. He said the Rufiji project offers significant value chain business opportunities for various stakeholders in the country that will have a multiplier effect on the development of the Tanzania’s economy and creation of wealth for its citizens. “As a major supporter of the Rufiji Project, UBA Tanzania has also developed various products specifically for the project to enable contractors obtain financial support in the areas of Bid Bond, Advance Payment Guarantee, Performance Bond, Invoice Discounting Facility, Contract Financing and overdraft that may be required for effective participation of local contractors in the project,” he said. Construction of the project is in progress and the government has shown that it means business, with parliament approving 1.44/-trillion in the 2019/20 financial year budget for the Rufiji Hydropower Project.
