THE Legal and Human Rights Centre (LHRC), has launched a new system to initiate human rights complaints with an online tool. LHRC Executive Director, Anna Henga told reporters in Dar es Salaam yesterday that the tool stimulates an online messaging platform and takes users through a series of questions to create a detailed and timed report of what has happened to them. “We hope the platform provides a new option for people who might not feel comfortable initiating a complaint, especially those in remote areas in villages,” she said. She added, “The good thing about this platform is that it has no time limit, if anyone wants to file a complaint at two o’clock in the morning on their phone, that’s possible with this platform.” Ms Henga said the tools are user-friendly to all people as it uses a smartphone application, short messages and a website. for smartphone users, they can download the application from play store dubbed LHRC HRMS, send a short message via +255 699 695 486 or visit the commission’s website. The commission’s director said the information provided will be verified through several organs, including the police force, Commission for Human Rights and Good Governance (CHRAGG), the court, several ministries and other organisations whenever the need arises. She said the commission has introduced the platform as a pilot study for other stakeholders to use it and give their views for further improvements according to their needs. Meanwhile, as the world marked press freedom day, LHRC have reminded media stakeholders to maintain a solid foundation of the media industry in the country to ensure press freedom. Ms Henga urged community members to recognize the principles of press freedom for them to protect and prevent attacks on journalists.
