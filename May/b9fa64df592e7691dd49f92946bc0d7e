DEPUTY Energy Minister Subira Mgalu has directed contractors undertaking Rural Energy Agency (REA) projects to supply all hamlets with electricity to achieve the government’s goal of lighting all households in rural areas. Ms Mgalu issued the directive at an event to switch on electricity to the fishing village of Chibwegere in Mpwapwa District over the weekend, saying skipping any hamlet in power supply will weaken the government’s efforts in power supply. “Electricity supply is in line with the government’s main agenda of industrial economy because electricity facilitates operation of the industries,” said Ms Mgalu during the event to switch on electricity in Chibwegere village for the first time since independency. Chibwegere becomes the 42nd village in Mpwapwa District to receive electricity under REA programme III. The deputy minister advised Chibwegere residents, most of them engaged in fishing business, to make use of electricity to facilitate their fishing business, saying they can now store fish in refrigerators. Mpwapwa District Commissioner (DC) Jabir Shekimweri thanked the government for electricity supply in the village, urging Chibwegere villagers to protect power infrastructure against vandalism. “Every member of the community should play role in protecting electricity infrastructure in our areas,” said the DC. Meanwhile, the Deputy Minister directed Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO) to give top priority to households in project sites in electricity supply. “Tanesco should give priority to households in project sites in electricity supply after construction of power infrastructure,” said Ms Mgalu.
