THE House of Representatives has been informed that plans are underway to construct breakwaters/seawall as part of coastal management, to protect farms from seawater intrusion, which leads to land salinity. Deputy Minister for Agriculture, Natural resources, Livestock and Fisheries Dr Makame Ali Ussi said that sea erosion is a big problem along the Coastal areas, adding that farming in areas such as Tibirinzi Rice farms in Pemba has become impossible because of soil salinity. “We are working with ‘Department of Road Maintenance (UUB)’ to construct barriers to prevent erosion,” Dr Ussi said, adding that studies by Chinese and local experts are ongoing on the possibility of growing various crops especially rice on land invaded by sea water. The deputy Minister’s statement was in response to backbenchers’ concern over the growing effect of sea water on farms close to the coastal areas. Equally, Mr Zaharani Suleiman Said (Chaekechake), and Mr Suleiman Makame Ali (Ziwani) said the problem of sea erosions must be addressed.
