PROFESSIONAL golfer Abdallah Yusufu stunned his fellow pros and top amateurs, to be crowned this week’s Fiddle golf tournament champion. The weekly 18 holes stable ford tournament held at the Tanzania People’s Defence Forces (TPDF) Lugalo Golf Club of Dar es Salaam on Friday, saw Yusufu winning Division A top prize. Playing plus one handicap, Yusufu posted 32 points to finish top by a point in the close contest. He beat his closest challenger and one of regular figures at Friday Fiddle winning list, Marius Kajuna, handicap 6, who returned 31 points. Playing off handicap 9, former Tanzania Golf Union (TGU) President Joseph Tango, had 29 points to finish third. Speaking to the ‘Sunday News’ after the victory, Yusufu said it was a tough challenge to play in rainy weather condition. “Regardless, it’s always nice to face stiff challenge… the course was difficult to play and in some areas, rain left pools of water,” he said. As usual, Lugalo combined pros who were given plus one handicap to challenge top golfers who play in Division A at the weekly event, to help both improve their game. Division B top prize went to Fabian Magoti handicap 17, who fired 34 points, as TGU competition Secretary Enock Magile managed 12 handicap, had 31 points at second position. Division C saw Samweli Kileo who returned 19 points, winning the top prize. In the ladies category, Hadija Khamis was unstoppable, scooping top prize with 35 points best of the week for all divisions, as second place went to Joyce Warega, who hit 31 points. Winners were awarded prizes by Club captain Japhet Masai, who thanked all participants for taking part in the competition.
