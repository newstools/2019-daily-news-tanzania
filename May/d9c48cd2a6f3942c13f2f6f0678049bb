TANZANIA Golf Union (TGU) is in a final process to start implementing the new World Handicap System (WHS) recently drafted by the world governing body. Golf’s WHS, which is designed to bring the game of golf under a single set of rules for handicapping and provide a more consistent measure of players’ ability between different regions of the world, remains on track for implementation starting in 2020. World Golf Governing Body, The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews (R&A) of Scotland recently began educating golfers through events being held in Singapore, South Africa, Great Britain and Ireland, Japan, Argentina, Brazil, Continental Europe, Canada, the Caribbean and the USA, some of which Tanzania Golf Union (TGU) handicap secretary Saidi Nkya attended. TGU president, Chris Martin told the ‘Daily News’ from Moshi, Kilimanjaro yesterday that the union has already brought Council of National Golf Unions (CONGU) handicap system ready to implement it in recording and controlling the handicaps of the country’s golfers. “It is useful initiative, as a country we have already taken a step forward. This new system will only give TGU mandate to control golfers’ handicaps in the country. All tournaments scores from weekly fiddle, monthly mugs, clubs competitions and national level events should be sent to TGU handicap secretary who control the system,” he said. Martin Slumbers, the Chief Executive of The R&A said in a press release that this paper has its copy: “There are many ways in which it is important for golf to modernise and become more appealing for people thinking of taking up the sport and handicapping is clearly one of them. “WHS is a major new initiative for the sport which will establish a clearer and more consistent handicapping process for golfers throughout the world.”
