COFFEE farmers who are members of Lyamungo Agricultural Marketing & Cooperative Society (AMCOS) in Hai District, Kilimanjaro Region have in the past three coffee collection seasons enjoyed high yields thanks to new varieties of Arabica coffee seedlings and good farming practices. The Chairman of the Board of AMCOS, Mr Gabriel Ulomi said here recently that the new varieties of Arabica coffee seedlings invented and distributed to farmers by the Tanzania Coffee Research Institute (TaCRI) have the characteristics of giving high yields per unit area. Alongside high yields, they are also resistant to coffee deadly diseases namely Coffee Berry Disease (CBD) and Coffee Leaf Rust (CLR) thus reducing production costs as less fungicide and herbicides were required. He said they also produce coffee with bigger bean sizes having good flavour which is liked by many people across the globe, thus fetching good prices in the world market. “In 2015/16 coffee collection season Lyamungo AMCOS farmers earned a total of 58.9m/- after selling 19,623 kilogrammes of coffee and in 2016/17 respective farmers earned a total of 150m/- after selling 30,000 kilogrammes of coffee,” he said. He added that as for the 2017/18 coffee collecting season farmers earned a total of 200m/- after selling 40,000 kilogrammes of coffee after fetching 5,000/- per kilogramme following favourable world market prices. “TaCRI is our neighbour and as such our farmers are first and nearby ones to tap the inventions made by TaCRI. TaCRI officials also visit our farmers regularly and instruct them on good coffee farming practices,” he said.
