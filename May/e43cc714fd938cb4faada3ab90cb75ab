NATIONAL Investments Company (NICOL) invests in listed shares (main business) as well as in other ventures, for which it presently has two subsidiaries. During 2018, the NICOL Group recorded 254 per cent year-on-year increase in profit after tax, before accounting for changes in the fair value of listed shares held. Operating profit increased by 4.0bn/- (167 per cent) to 1.65bn/- from a loss of 2.45bn/- recorded a year earlier. Revenues from the two subsidiaries dropped by 27 per cent to 1.39bn/- from 1.93bn/- leading to a decline in gross profit by nearly half to 582m/- from 1.16bn/-. The Group results were boosted by other income, which recorded a drastic (2,243 per cent) increase to 4.24bn/- from 181m/- recorded last year. NICOL itself, the company, accounted for 1.26bn/- or 30 per cent of the other income, the rest being attributable to the subsidiaries. Investment income which is the main source of income for the company decreased by 34 per cent to 1.35bn/-. The net change in fair value of investments recorded a loss of 13.63bn/- leading to total comprehensive loss of 9.52bn/- from a profit of 1.86bn/-. Before providing for the loss in fair value of investments, earnings per share increased by 145 per cent to 81/- from 33/-. The balance sheet size dropped by 10bn/- to 99bn/- from 89bn/-, largely on account of the loss in fair value of investments. Commentary on the Results NICOL recorded improved profitability in 2018, whereas its investments in securities depreciated in value by 14 per cent. The main reason for the increase in profit was a jump in other income from a mere 181m/- in 2017 to 4.24bn/- in 2018. It remains unclear whether this income source/magnitude is sustainable. As a result, the operating profit margin increased to 118 per cent from -126 per cent (loss) from a year earlier. Return on Assets (ROA) increased to 4.5 per cent from 1.04 per cent while return on equity (ROE), increased to 4.79 per cent from 1.21 per cent. Earnings per share increased by 145 per cent against the capital loss of 14 per cent. The future performance of NICOL is directly related to the performance of its investments, most of which are companies listed on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE). It should be noted that in a portfolio of 84bn/- worth of shares listed on the DSE, NMB constitutes about 91 per cent at 77bn/-. This poses a big risk because if NMB shares fall in price, the impact will be felt directly by NICOL. It therefore calls for diversification strategies. Currently, the NICOL stock is trading at 170, which is a 34 per cent decrease from the price of 270/- in January 2019. ‚óè Happy Msale, CFA, is an Investment Analyst TSL Investment Management L td a subsidiary of Tanzania Securities L imited. happy@ tim.co.tz
