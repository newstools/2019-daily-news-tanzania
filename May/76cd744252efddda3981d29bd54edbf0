THE government in the 2019/2020 financial year has allocated about 34.6m/- for period maintenance of Kibaoni-Lukuyu and Visomoro-Bumu- Mwarazi roads, as well as the construction of vented drift at Songa River in Mvomero District, Morogoro Region. This was said by the Deputy Minister in the President’s Office, Regional Administration and Local Government, Josephat Kandege, at the National Assembly when responding to a question by Special Seats lawmaker, Dr Jasmin Bunga (CCM). In her main question, the MP said some roads in the district were in bad condition, asking the government when it would allocate funds for the construction of the roads. Responding, Mr Kandege said the feasibility study for 13.8 kilometres Kidiwa-Tandali-Maguruwe road had already been completed by the Tanzania Rural and Urban Roads Agency (TARURA). According to him, about 2.8bn/- was needed for rehabilitation works, including the building of bridges. “The government continues with its plan to raise funds for these projects,’’ said the Deputy Minister.
