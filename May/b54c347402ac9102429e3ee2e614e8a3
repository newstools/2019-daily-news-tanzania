IN a bid to increase the level of sunflower productivity, the Small Industries Development Organisation (SIDO) has appealed to smallholder sunflower farmers here to form business clusters. Dodoma Regional SIDO Manager Sempeho Manongi, stressed at a recent training workshop for small scale farmers that business clusters were vital for entrepreneurship skills enhancement, production efficiency, collaboration and innovation. “While a farmer operating alone may not get support from organisations, business clusters stand to get support from them,” the manager said. Mr Manongi observed that SIDO had been engaged in cluster development largely in facilitating industrial estates for specific sectors and provision of technical support, training opportunities and advisory services. Mr Manongi said cluster development had in recent years been stagnant in the country, pointing out that SIDO had continued to support the Small and Medium Entrepreneurs (SMEs) in clusters system. “We have continued to support those in clusters in terms of provision of processing skills and training in packaging and facilitation of certification of the Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority (TFDA) and Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS),” he said. Mr Manongi cited the main goal of SIDO as contribution to the country’s transformation into a diversified and semi industrialised economy through promoting and developing industrial clusters which were inclusive, vibrant, innovative, resilient and evolving. “SIDO has a mandate to support SMEs development by using its resources through infrastructure, expertise, experience and mechanism,” he said. Last week, SIDO unveiled a 13-acre of land at Kizota area in Dodoma Municipality where it would put up infrastructure for small and medium industries to facilitate an industrialisation revolution in the country’s designated capital city.
