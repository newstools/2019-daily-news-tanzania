UNIVERSITY of Dodoma (UDOM) in collaboration with Ohio State University and Global Water Institute (GWI) has launched its first ever Business Plan Competition Programme by awarding three teams of undergraduate students whose business ideas emerged the best. The students who were awarded are from UDOM School of Business Studies and Economics (SBSE) and according to the competition coordinator, Dr Joel Mmasa, the SBSE students were sensitized regarding the programme objectives and philosophy. “After sensitization, ten teams registered for competition, with each team constituting three members and before commencement of their work, the team had to undertake two sessions related to writing a Winning Business Plan and presenting them, a seminar that was provided by Dr Michael Camp from Ohio State University. The aim of the training, according to Dr Mmasa, was to equip researchers with hand on tools and skills on how to write a winning business plan and be able to defend the plan. According to him, the teams were mentored, coached and trained online for six weeks. Finally, seven teams managed to submit their business plan proposals for evaluations. Three finalists were selected by the judges, consisting of Dr Martin Kress, Executive Director of Global Water Institute for Coordination, Dr Cyril Chami, Prof Keely Croxton, Ms Christina Meela, Ms Teri Gilead, Dr Michael Camp and Mohammed Shire. Speaking at the function, Professor Said Ali Vuai, who represented the Deputy Vice Chancellor-Academics, asked the coordinator of the competition to ensure that the winners were incubated under innovation spaces and Incubation Centre and then linked to Tanzania Private Sectors Foundation (TPSF) for financial support or linked with other potential investors. “We also believe this event will open more doors to collaboration between us, for a better understanding of our ideas and ensuring that we all contribute to development of our country,’’ he noted.
