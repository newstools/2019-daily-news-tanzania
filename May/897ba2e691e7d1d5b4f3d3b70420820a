THE Small Industries Development Organisation’s (SIDO) says that its agroindustrial initiative known as One District One Product (ODOP) is gaining ground countrywide. Speaking to journalists here recently, the SIDO Director General, Professor Sylvester Mpanduji, cited Singida, Mbeya, Dodoma, Manyara and Morogoro regions as having excelled in embracing the imitative. He explained that production of sunflower, maize, paddy and green vegetables have increased and agro-industrial plants have been built to process the produce. “We have evidence that this programme has encouraged economic growth in districts that have adopted it. Farmers have increased crop production and a home-grown industrial base is gaining ground in innovative districts. The growth contribution of this programme is now visible at district up to national levels,” the professor explained. Under this programme, a district chooses the most popular crop or livestock or fisheries product and gives it priority in its development programme in order to raise the people’s welfare and disposable income. Prof Mpanduji called on regions and district leaders to embrace the ODOP initiative in order to speed up the national industrialisation programme and contribute positively to the national efforts towards making Tanzania an industrialised middle-income nation by 2025. The Acting Director of Marketing and Investment, Ms Shoma Kibende, said that on the whole, many districts have understood the logic behind the ODOP initiative and have used it to mobilize peasants to increase crop production. “Where the initiative has been applied, peasants have accessed ready markets because peasants are selling produce to agro-industries in their own districts,” she explained. She added that SIDO’s principal role in the initiative is to ensure that districts produce quality products for local and external markets.
