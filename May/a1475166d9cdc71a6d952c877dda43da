THE government has completed preparing the draft report of the Voluntary National Review (VNR) on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and presented to the stakeholders for more improvement. Preparation of the report was coordinated by the ministry of finance and planning that worked with various stakeholders from Mainland and Zanzibar, including key government ministries, departments and agencies, UN agencies, civil society, the private sector, women and youth groups. The key stakeholders were also part of the workshop held in Dodoma this week to discuss the draft document to improve it and produce the final report, which the government is expected to present at the annual High- Level Political Forum which takes place at the UN Headquarters in New York. Tanzania is among the 48 countries that will be presenting their report at the 2019 forum which will be taking place under the theme of “Empowering People and Ensuring Inclusiveness and Equality.” In line with the theme, Tanzania’s report will focus on SDG 4: Quality Education; SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth; SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities; SDG 13: Climate Action; SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; and SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals. Tanzania’s report outlines key achievements as well as challenges related to the implementation of the select SDGs. As part of its follow-up and review mechanisms, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development encourages UN member states to conduct regular and inclusive reviews of progress being made on the SDGs at the national and sub-national levels. Speaking at the workshop, Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Finance and Planning Ministry Adolf Ndunguru said the process of conducting the review was consultative, participatory, iterative, transparent and inclusive, engaging all key stakeholders in the country.
