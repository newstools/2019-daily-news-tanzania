This revelation was made in the National Assembly here yesterday by the Deputy Minister for Works, Transport and Communications, Elias Kwandikwa. The Deputy Minister said the government was currently in negotiations with various development partners, who have shown interest to finance the construction of a new terminal building at one of the country’s busiest airports. “We are in good stages of negotiations, and we expect by October this year, construction of the project will begin for Mwanza to get a modern passenger’s terminal,” he said when responding to a question by Chadema Special Seats MP, Susan Massele. The MP had demanded to know when the fast growing Mwanza City will get a modern airport. Mr Kwandikwa further said that at the moment, Mwanza Airport was undergoing massive renovation which started seven years ago. He said the renovation work has reached 87 per cent and the contractor-- Beijing Construction Engineering Group Company Ltd (BCEG), will accomplish the task come end of June this year. The Deputy Minister told the house that the government entered a 89.3bn/- deal with the Chinese company in October 2012 for the construction and upgrading of the Mwanza airport infrastructures. He said from that amount, the government is footing 82.5 per cent, while the remaining 17.5 per cent is covered by development partners.
