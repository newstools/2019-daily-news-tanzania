THE government yesterday launched Criminal Justice Transformation Programme to transform the criminal justice system for quality and standard of service delivery improvements. While speaking at an event to launch the programme here yesterday, Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa, said the programme should come up with solutions to address congestion of inmates in Prisons. “There are some cases, which should end in amicable settlements before reaching a Court of Law, yet they all end up there and the suspects remanded, hence increase the number of inmates in Prisons,” said the Premier, in a speech delivered on his behalf by Information, Culture, Arts and Sports Minister, Dr Harrison Mwakyembe. Mr Majaliwa noted that the transformation should also focus on provision of entrepreneurship skills to inmates, and those who are remanded to enable them carry out productive activities for the Prisons, and stop depending on the Central Government to cover their costs of food. He said the scheme should address a number of challenges facing the criminal justice system, pointing out among them as bribery, and cases being delayed to be heard, and some inmates being remanded without justified reasons. On his part, Minister for Constitutional and Legal Affairs, Dr Augustine Mahiga, said that his ministry decided to undertake the criminal justice system purge to keep pace with the current socioeconomic, political, and environmental as well as technological changes taking place in the public. “Based on the development agenda, and transformation initiatives in the criminal justice subsector, it is inevitable to form an engine of economic growth in the country, which accelerates attaining Tanzania Development Vision of 2025,” he said. Dr Mahiga further said that the transformation process being undertaken in the country would not only help justice institutions, but also the general public, who are the consumers of the services. Commenting on the programme, the Ministry of Constitutional and Legal Affairs Permanent Secretary (PS), Prof Sifuni Mchome, said despite a number of reforms undertaken so far, there are still much a lot to be done for the country to have a better criminal justice system for the public.
