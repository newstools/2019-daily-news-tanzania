The revelation was made by Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries Development, Prof Elisante Ole Gabriel during a one day working tour of Rukwa region, where he visited and inspected the construction of a wall around the Kasesya auction bordering neighbouring Zambia in Kalambo district. Prof Ole Gabriel named the five livestock auction markets whose infrastructures were under construction with their regions in brackets as Kasesya (Rukwa), Buhigwe (Kigoma), Longido (Arusha), Murusagamba (Kagera) and Nyamatara in Misungwi district, Mwanza region. While at Kasesya auction market bordering neighbouring Zambia, Prof Ole Gabriel said the construction of the requisite infrastructure at Kasesya livestock public sale started in 2007 at a cost of over 345m/= “Accomplishment of this project will definitely control smuggling of livestock, mostly herds of cattle to neighbouring Zambia as well as improving revenue collections,” insisted Prof Ole Gabriel.
