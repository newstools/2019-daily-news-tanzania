HANANG District Commissioner (DC) Mr Joseph Mkirikiti has imposed a ban on local Toyaa, a Barbaig traditional gathering. Mr Mkirikiti said that such gatherings are ‘oppressive’ to some groups in the communities, and hence must be stopped. “These meetings were meant to bring harmony in the district, instead they have continuously been a source of increasing cases of child rapes and molestations,” he recently pointed out. According to Mr Mkirikiti, the gatherings which are usually facilitated by clan elders among the Barbaig communities, do not include, and also do not incorporate views from women, thus encouraging social ills in the areas. He alleged that men from the Barbaig communities still embrace some outdated customs and traditions, which oppress women in the areas, and hence must be outlawed. “It becomes a bit tricky to resolve gender related cases, because the men in this area do sanction such outlawed practices in their meetings,” the DC said. He further said that his office was already making a follow up of two registered related cases from Endasak and Gendabi villages. However, Mr Mkirikiti said that the accused in the alleged child rape case has been taken to court, only for the parent of the affected child to be excommunicated from the community, and advised not to attend the Toyaa, that is affecting him. According to Mr Mkirikiti, the parent of the child was estranged by the community for allegedly reporting the matter to law enforcers.
