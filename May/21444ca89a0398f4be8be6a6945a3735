PARLIAMENT was told yesterday that the government had already forwarded a request to employ 15,000 health workers to ensure that there is no shortage of staff, especially in the village areas. Deputy Minister of State in the Presidentâ€™s Office (Regional Administration and Local Government), Josephat Kandege made the revelation to the National Assembly on Wednesday evening, while winding up the budget estimates for the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender Elderly and Children, adding that if the permission would be granted, things would be okay. Reinforcing that yesterday, the deputy Minister in the same ministry, while responding to a question posed by Manyoni West legislator, Yahaya Massare said that the government through Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF) was constructing Health Centres, which would be occupied by the new employees. Among the villages that he mentioned were Sanjaranda, Kitopeni, Ipande, Doroto, Itagata, Kalangali, Makule, Mmamangembe and Kintanula, which recently are not staffed with health workers. Equally, Kilolo MP, Mr Venance Mwamoto (CCM), had expressed concern that despite being along the Tanzania-Zambia Highway (TANZAM), Kilolo District lacks a health centre and as a result, its residents are being forced to seek medical services in Iringa Town. The Deputy Minister assured the MPs that the government is committed to construct health facilities countrywide, including Kilolo District.
