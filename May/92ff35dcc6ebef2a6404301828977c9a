THE sky is the limit for a multimillion dollar horticultural industry, thanks to the global standard setting body for accrediting Tanzania Horticultural Association (Taha) to ensure local growers produce in compliance with the international market. As it stands now, Taha, a $700 million horticultural industry driver is a Global Good Agricultural Practice (Global GAP) Licensed Farm Assurer Company, offering a ray of hope to millions of local fresh produce to meet international stringent safety standards. A breakthrough will help support participation of Tanzania’s horticultural industry in the region and global value chains by enhancing competitiveness of the country’s exports for it to exploit fully its trade-driven growth potential. Chief Operations Officer for Global GAP, a private global standard that sets out requirements for farming processes and food safety, Mr Markus Philipp said Taha had been listed on their website as a farm assurer. “We also accepted Mr Eric Mwesigwa to be the representative of Farm Assurer with Global GAP,” wrote Mr Philipp to Taha, adding that the Taha officer responsible for standards and food safety would assist his body to coordinate activities. Experts say the Global GAP’s move to trust Taha to carry out most prevalent certifications means to open doors for million Tanzanian exporters, it will build international buyers’ confidence in product quality and attract higher prices. “The benefits of having Global GAP certification includes access to new business opportunities, especially in the European market that consumes 80 per cent of Tanzania horticultural produce and the ability to earn higher incomes through price increase for their nowcertified products,” said Taha Group CEO Jacqueline Mkindi. Taha’s being the world’s standards certification agency means that, it strategically suited to offer services to farmers and exporters on the implementation of Global GAP standards at primary production sites.
