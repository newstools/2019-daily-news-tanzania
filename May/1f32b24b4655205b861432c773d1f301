LIVESTOCK Training Agency (LITA), plans to set up agro-business incubators in its five campuses to provide its graduates with a platform where they can generate business ideas and receive support in livestock farming business. Acting Director of Production Unit at LITA, Mr Balija Luyombya, said here yesterday that the progranme would benefit at least 100 graduates in the beginning, saying the main goal of the programme is to address the unemployment problem for its graduates. “The agro-business incubators will be fully equipped to facilitate agro-processing. The programme targets to create employment opportunities to LITA graduates and youth in general,” said Mr Luoyombya during an ongoing technological education and vocation training institutions exhibition. He said LITA came up with the idea to set up agrobusiness incubators after a survey which established that only 1.6 per cent of graduates who undertook livestock farming studies employed themselves between 2011 and 2017. Mr Luyombya said LITA will impart entrepreneurship skills to beneficiaries of agrobusiness incubators, saying the agency will be selecting best graduates to benefit from the 18-month programme. “The graduates will also receive employability skills at the LITA agro-business incubators. The incubators will be designed to help kick-start small businesses by providing guidance to the graduates” he said.
