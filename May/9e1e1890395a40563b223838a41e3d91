SPEAKER of the National Assembly Job Ndugai has temporarily suspended representation of Tanzania’s representative who is also the First Vice-President of the Pan-African Parliament (PAP), Mr Stephen Masele, for allegation of misconduct. Mr Ndugai has thus recalled Mr Masele from the continental assembly which is based in Midrand, South Africa. The recalled MP is also a former member of Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) based in Genève Switzerland. The Shinyanga Urban is now required to appear before the Parliamentary Privileges, Ethics and Powers Committee as well as Ethics Committee of his party Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), Mr Ndugai told lawmakers on Thursday. “Mr Masele has exhibited high levels of indiscipline which tarnishes the image of this august House. He went further and caused strains between pillars of the state. I wrote to him asking him to come back home since last Monday but he has refused,” Mr Ndugai, who is also Kongwa MP, explained. The Speaker said he had as well written to the President of PAP informing him of the decision by the Tanzanian parliament to temporarily to suspend representation of Mr Masele pending appearance at the ethics committee in Tanzania. “When I wrote to him (Masele) he responded to suggest that he had received separate instructions from the Prime Minister to disregard my directive. This is however not true, he should come back home and respond to the allegations,” Mr Ndugai stressed. Mr Masele was elected First Vice-President of PAP in May, last year, while Handeni Rural MP, Ms Mboni Mhita (CCM), was elected President of the youth caucus of PAP for three years.
