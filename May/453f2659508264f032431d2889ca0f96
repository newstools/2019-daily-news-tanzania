DISMAL performance by Serengeti Boys at the just concluded U-17 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) finals 2019 hosted by Tanzania has annoyed President John Magufuli. The President was wondering how the Under-17 national football team failed to use the home advantage. “It is a disappointment that we were beaten when the tournament was held in our country and in our own stadiums. The team (Serengeti Boys) was always at the receiving end as they were beaten in all three matches,” Magufuli sadly recounted. The Head of State, who spoke for the first time yesterday on the poor performance by Serengeti Boys during the continental tournament, expressed skepticism whether the national senior side, Taifa Stars will record impressive performance in the forthcoming AFCON 2019 slated for Egypt in June, this year. President Magufuli was speaking during a public rally at John Mwakangale grounds in Kyela District as part of his working visit in Mbeya Region. “I always get hurt when our teams are beaten in international tournaments. Tanzania has a population of over 50 million people but our teams are beaten by countries with a population of just 10 million people,” he stated. President Magufuli tasked the Minister for Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, Harrison Mwakyembe, who happened to be MP for Kyela, to address poor performance of the national teams. “Otherwise, I don’t know for how long shall you continue to bear the shame of these teams in your capacity as minister responsible for sports,” he quipped. Serengeti Boys lost 5-4 in their opener against Nigeria, beaten 3-0 by Uganda and lost 4-2 at the hands of Angola in the group stage of the finals.
