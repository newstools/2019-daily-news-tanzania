TANZANIA’s Mufti—Chief Sheikh—Abubakar Zubeiry has appealed all Muslims in the country to use the holy month of Ramadan to pray for the nation’s peace and tranquility. Sheikh Zubeiry told imams of all Mosques countrywide to lead their followers to do the right things as directed by the holy book of Quran, which he said is the book full of teachings of peace and tranquility. “Islam isn’t for conflicts, let’s focus on development because conflicts have no benefits…this isn’t time for confrontations, it’s time for development,” Mufti Zubeiry counseled the Muslims while addressing reporters in Dar es Salaam yesterday. He made the call upon his return from Saudi Arabia where he was on a sevenday visit to grasp some new knowledge on how Muslim organisations in that country conduct their activities. The visit also was intended to cement relationship between the offices of the Mufti of the two countries. Mufti Zubeiry believes that his visit to Saudi Arabia has brought the Islam in Tanzania to international level, making it known and promoting the country at large. “During my visit, I had talked with imam of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, Sheikh Abdul Rahman Ibn Abdul Aziz as-Sudais and Saudi Arabia’s grand mufti, Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al-Asheikh over several issues for the benefits of Muslims in Tanzania and the country at large,” he stated. He further noted that the knowledge that he and his delegates acquired from Saudi Arabia will positively change the Muslim leadership in Tanzania. Speaking over the importance of fasting during the Holy month of Ramadan, the Mufti said it’s one of the prayers, which help Muslims to get rid of evil acts, which are against the teachings of Holy Quran. He said fasting is also good for their health as per the teachings of Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam.
