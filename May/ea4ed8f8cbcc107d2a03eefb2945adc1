THE government has promised to review skills development levy (SDL) of 4.5 per cent imposed on employers. SDL is charged based on the gross pay of all payments made by the employer to the employees employed by such employer at a particular time. It is important to understand that SDL is due and payable by an employer. The governmentâ€™s consideration comes after complaints from stakeholders that the amount is high. Deputy Minister for Education, Science and Technology William Ole Nasha told the Parliament yesterday about the government's move. Mr Nasha explained some of the stakeholders had raised concerns over the amount, including the Association of Tanzania Employers (ATE). ATE had presented the agenda to President John Magufuli, who directed the responsible minister to organise a meeting, involving the government, employers and employees to discuss the matter and start a process of reviewing it. The deputy minister said this after a question from Tabora North MP Almas Maige (CCM), who wanted to know why the government shouldn't reduce the levy. Asking the basic question, the MP noted that employers had been paying the levy for each employee. The levy is supposed to be handed over to the Vocational Education and Training Authority (VETA) for developing skills. The MP wanted also to know the amount of money that so far had been given to VETA. Mr Nasha responded, saying SDL had been collected by the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) as mandated by the law. He elaborated that the law explained that the employer, who had employed at least four employees was supposed to pay SDL, which is 4.5 per cent of gross salary. VETA gets one third of the collected amount.
