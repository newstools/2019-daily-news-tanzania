FORTY one people have been feared dead after a Russian plane made an emergency landing and burst into flames just moments after takeoff from Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport. In the scene, there were dramatic video shows of passengers using emergency exit slides to escape the burning Aeroflot aircraft. However, survivors of the plane associated the incident of lightning striking it, but Russia's national carrier said that it returned to the airport for technical reasons. Two children are among the dead in the jet that was carrying 73 onboard as well as five crews. Initial reports suggested the plane had landed with a ball fire, but sources quoted by Russian News Agency- Interfax that it caught fire after a bumpy landing. â€œThe aircraft landed with full fuel tanks because the crew lost contact with air traffic controller and decided it was too dangerous to dump fuel over Moscow. "There are 37 survivors - 33 passengers and four members of the crew," pointed out Yelena Markovskaya, an official involved in the investigation of the crash. A flight attendant was also reportedly killed in the incident, leaving five people in hospital, said a witness who described the scene as a "miracle" that some managed to escape.
