RORYA DC, Simon Chacha has directed area Councillors to spearhead the ongoing construction of collective cattle reserve centres in their wards aimed at intensifying the fight against theft and banditry in the district. The decision, said the official, was among the latest strategies, which the district’s defense and security committee has come up with in its bid to stem rustling and banditry among different communities represented here, which have been at loggerheads over cattle rustling for quite some time. Addressing a full council meetings held in Utegi yesterday, the DC noted that Rorya has, in the past few months, experienced numerous cases of banditry and cattle raids, which prompt residents to consume much time pursuing rustlers that have caused negative impact on the socio-economic fortunes of wananchi. ‘’The authorities here are not prepared to witness this agriculturally-rich region being turned into a valley of death, with people being killed unnecessarily while scores of families fail to attend to their homes and daily routines because of these merciless cattle robbers’’, he stressed. The DC emphasized that the re-emergence of cattle rustling in the district calls for urgent intervention, due to the fact that most incidents are taking place in broad daylight, in an area with the presence of security personnel, that is the Tarime/Rorya special police zone. However, in most cases some of the attackers were arrested and cases proceeding in court. Mr Chacha noted that the major responsibility of the fifth phase administration, under President John Magufuli is to provide total safety and security to the citizenry, free from any criminal menace while allowing all country residents access their social, economic and political rights guaranteed by the Constitution. He revealed some of the advanced security stages taken, which include numerous operations to mop up illegal guns in the wrong hands that have of late been largely instrumental in acts of lawlessness in the district, and making sure cattle rustlers are not allowed to continue their reign of terror against innocent civilians.
