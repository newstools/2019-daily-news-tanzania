THE Tanzania Wildlife Management Authority (Tawa) has been urged to monitor and protect natural resources so that they benefit present and future generations. Speaking during the launch of the Tawa board recently, Minister for Tourism and Natural Resources, Dr Hamis Kigwangalla, said that could only be achieved if Tawa was guided by integrity and patriotism. He urged board members to ensure they abided by laws and regulations so that natural resources lasted for a long time. “You have all powers. Exercise them fully and wisely so that natural resources, including wildlife, last for a long time,” he noted. Dr Kigwangalla also wanted them to fast-track issuance of hunting blocks and ensure payments were effected. The minister said the government would ensure a law was enacted to empower Tawa and make it an independent entity so that it could deliver efficiently. Earlier, Tawa Board Chairman, Maj Gen Hamis Semfuko, said they would be guided by laws and regulations and creativity to get intended results. Moreover, he said, they would have statistics of natural resources to make it easier for them to come up with a workable strategy that would ensure the natural resources lasted for a long time. The board chairman told the minister that it was their wish that wildlife contribution to the GDP reached 35 per cent by 2025.
