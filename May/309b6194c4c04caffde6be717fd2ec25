SIX Muleba residents were on Monday convicted of arson and sentenced to life imprisonment. The convicts were identified as Revocatus Salvatory (26) –the Hamlet Chairman for Kyamate, Ponsian Isaya (47), Felecian Petro (36), Gosbert Rwakamela (51), Jackson Rukiza (47) and Winifrida Revocatus (24), all residents of Bisheke Ward, in Muleba District. Prosecuting, Assistant Inspector of Police, Charles Mpelwa told the court during hearing of the Criminal Case No. 215/2018 that the six accused persons jointly conspired and set on fire a house belonging to Novatus Mugisha (46), a resident of Kyamate Hamlet, at Miranda village. The accused persons also cut down Mugisha’s banana in his plantation, causing loss to properties estimated at 2.2m/-. According to the prosecutor, the motive was due to the convicts accusing Mugisha’s wife, identified as Restituta Novatus, to be a witchdoctor, and the offence was committed on July 18, last year. Mr Mpelwa prayed for a stiff sentence to stop other people from such acts of taking the law into their own hands. Before passing the sentence, Resident Magistrate Benedict Nkomola observed that the prosecution proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. He also noted that incidents of mob justice were on the increase, warning that if such criminal acts were left unchecked, it could lead to breach of peace. Magistrate Nkomola sentenced the six accused to life imprisonment for torching the house and one year in jail for destroying a banana plantation
