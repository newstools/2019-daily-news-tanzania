THE Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) has urged Simba SC to stage a competitive performance when they host Sevilla FC on May 23rd at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam. The Spanish side are set to land in the country on May 21st, two days ahead of the historic friendly match, which has been made possible by Sport- Pesa Tanzania in collaboration with LaLiga. This will be the second time for SportPesa Tanzania to bring a decorated club from Europe after the arrival of English Premier League side Everton FC in 2017. Everton played against Gor Mahia at the same venue in a game to round up that year's SportPesa Super Cup, which was won by the Kenyan team. Speaking yesterday, TFF President Wallace Karia encouraged Simba players to take this friendly match seriously and display outstanding performance. “As you know, opportunities like these in football are hard to come by, hence when they come, use them effectively,” Karia said. He further said the whole world will be watching closely this tie as such, the possibility of securing a chance to play outside the country is high through different football agents, who are searching talented players to be featured in their squads. He then commended Sport- Pesa Tanzania for its support it renders towards facilitating the growth of football in the country bearing in mind that they currently sponsor three teams which are Simba, Young Africans and Singida United. On his part, SportPesa Tanzania Director of Administration and Compliance Tarimba Abbas also urged Simba players to seize this chance wholeheartedly.
