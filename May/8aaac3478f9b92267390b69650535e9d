THE management of Namungo FC has announced that they will sign four international players to reinforce the squad ahead of the next league season. Namungo graduated into the Mainland Premier League following their outstanding performance in the First Division League (FDL) which saw them topping group A with 46 points after 21 games. The Lindi based side lost a single match en route to the promotion to become the only club in FDL to lose one game throughout the rousing campaign. It will be their debut appearance in the 20-team competition and they are likely going to offer resistance to many teams in the race only if they will be able to capture right players to withstand the league’s tempo. Speaking through a radio interview recently, the club’s chairman Hassan Zidadu reiterated that bringing new players on board is the only ingredient to help them succeed in the tight top flight league since their mission is to compete and not to participate. He said doing perfect in the FDL is not a guarantee that they can do the same in the Mainland Premier League since the two competitions are different. “We have found that the only way to excel in the league is by having competent players who can execute well the intended job and in order to achieve that, you cannot run away from signing new players,” Zidadu said. He then revealed that the foreign based players they want to capture before the commencement of the league as recommended by the team’s coach come from Burkina Faso, Rwanda and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) while the fourth one is already trading in the country’s top flight league. He also disclosed that five members of the team will be allowed to leave despite helping to propel the side into the senior league. “We would have loved to keep all our players but due to limited space available, we have no other option apart from bidding farewell some of them. As a club, we will thank them in a special way,” he said.
