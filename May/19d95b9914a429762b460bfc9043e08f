OVER 200 Tanzanian soldiers were yesterday deployed to Darfur, Sudan, for a peacekeeping mission using Tanzania’s Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Tanzania People’s Defence Forces’ (TPDF) Head of Training and Operations Major General Alfred Kapinga said it’s the first time in 12 years, the Tanzanian army has deployed troops to the UN-peace keeping missions using own plane. “For the first time we have used our own Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. This has not only motivated the troops’ spirit but has increased their confidence,” he said. He commended efforts and respect the troops have brought to Tanzania and army from all UN peacekeeping missions that the country has participated to. “The Tanzanian army is among the highly respected in the peace missions and that is why more responsibility is given to it,” he boasted. The Commanding Officer of the deployed troops, Lieutenant Colonel Khalfan Kayage said the 217 soldiers left yesterday to replace their counterparts who are supposed to return home. Air Tanzania Company Limited (ATCL) Managing Director Ladislaus Matindi said the UN has shown great trust on the country’s carrier. “Other companies like the Ethiopian Airlines competed for the same tender,” he said, commending TPDF for being patriotic in supporting ATCL to get the opportunity.
