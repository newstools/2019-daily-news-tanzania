BRITISH national, Derrick Tweedley appeared before the Kisutu Resident Magistrateâ€™s Court in Dar es Salaam yesterday, charged with obtaining over 700m/- from Mohamed Enterprise Tanzania Limited (MeTL) Group Chairman Gulam Dewji. The 85-year-old Briton denied the charge when he was arraigned before Resident Magistrate Maira Kasonde. The magistrate granted bail to the accused on conditions of depositing in court cash bail of 353.5m/-. In the alternative, the magistrate said, the accused could surrender in court a title deed of any property certified at the said amount. In addition to that, the magistrate directed the accused to secure two reliable sureties, who were required to sign a bond of similar amount. The accused failed to meet the set bail conditions and was ordered to go to remand. The case was adjourned to May 20, 2019 for mention. Investigations into the case, according to the prosecution, led by State Attorney Wankyo Simon, have not been completed. It is alleged that on December 9, 2016, within the city, with intent to defraud or deceive, the Briton obtained 300,000 US dollars, which is equivalent to 717m/-, from Mr Dewji by falsely pretending that he would transfer a certificate of title bearing two numbers to MeTL, while it was untrue.
