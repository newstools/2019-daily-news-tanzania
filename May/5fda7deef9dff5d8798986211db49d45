THE government, in conjunction with private sector, is developing a strategic action plan to develop forests, a move that will see massive tree planting in the country’s endangered forests. Addressing a Forest Development Working Group meeting here on Wednesday, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Natural Resources, Dr Adolf Mkenda, said the strategic action plan would involve seed tree supply. “The strategic plan will also promote forest product industries to make great contributions into national development,” said the permanent secretary who doubles as chairman for the forest development working group. The forest development working group meeting was hosted by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism. The group, which is tasked to seek solutions to challenges facing the country’s forests, draws its members from public and private sectors. Dr Mkenda said the strategic plan would also encourage the people to use alternative energy sources like gas and charcoal briquettes. On his part, the Co- Chairman for Forest Development Working Group, Mr Ben Sulus, expressed delight over the strategic action plan, noting that it would help forest products to make great contribution to the national economy. “So far, forest products contribute some three per cent into the Gross Domestic Products (GDP),” he said. Dr Felician Kilahama, one of the members of the forest development working group, said charcoal making remains a major challenge for forest development, saying a tonne of charcoal consignment is produced by between 10 and 12 tonnes of trees.
