MILLIONS of M u s l i m s around the world are expected to start observing the holiest month of Ramadan next Tuesday, according to Chief Sheikh, Mufti Abubakar Zubeir Bin Ali. However, Chief Sheikh Bin Zuberi has called upon Muslims in the country to report to relevant authorities under National Muslim Council of Tanzania (Bakwata) on the sighting of the moon. But, other observers say Ramadan this year may start either tomorrow or on Tuesday, depending on a confirmed sighting of the new moon. Mufti Zubeir appealed to traders, especially food vendors not to hike prices to give more Muslims an opportunity to observe the holy month. Ramadan, which is observed by the Muslim community, is a period of fasting to commemorate “the best of times”, which is seen as a time of spiritual reflection, improvement and increased devotion and worship. Muslims are expected to put more effort in following the teachings of Islam, and this includes fasting, which teaches people how to be more selfdisciplined and have empathy for the less fortunate. This annual observance is regarded as one of the Five Pillars of Islam; it’s the fourth of the Five Pillars of Islam. Although fasting is beneficial to the health, it is mainly a method of self-purification and self-restraint. By cutting oneself from worldly comforts, even for a short time, a fasting person focuses on his or her purpose in life by constantly being aware of the presence of God. Ramadan is often called ‘month of the Qur’an’, in which Muslims also believe that the Quran was revealed during Ramadan, and because of this, Muslims attempt to recite as much of the Qur’an as they can during the month. Most mosques recite one thirtieth of the Qur’an each night during the Taraweeh prayers, held in mosques after iftar, these are long night prayers, which are not obligatory, but highly recommended. Mosques are expected to be filled with worshippers who go to attend prayers, which usually last for one and a half to two hours.
