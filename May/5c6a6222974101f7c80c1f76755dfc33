FORMER Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) President, Leodegar Tenga will re-contest the Confederation of African Football (CAF) Executive Member position. According to sources within TFF, Tenga, one of Africa’s finest football administrators and former Tanzania International who played for Taifa Stars in the 1980 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) finals, will re-contest for the post during the elective general assembly set for July 18th this year in Cairo, Egypt. Tenga has been a member of the CAF Exco since 2011 when he was elected. “Yes it's true Tenga will be seeking re-election and as TFF it's always an honour to recommend a man of his calibre and leadership qualities that he has not only shown in Tanzania or the Cecafa region but both at CAF and FIFA," a top TFF official was quoted as saying by www.soka25east. com. To re-contest the CAF Executive member position, Tenga needs a recommendation letter from the TFF as the country representative. Six Executive positions are up for grabs Northern Zone, Western Zones A and B, Central Zone, Central East Zone and Southern Zone whose office bearers are Jamal El Jaffri from Libya, Augustine Senghor from Senegal, Sita Sangare from Burkina Faso, Patrice Ngaissona from Central Africa Republic, Leodegar Tenga from Tanzania and Kalusha Bwalya from Zambia.
