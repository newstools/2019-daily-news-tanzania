75 members of staff at the Kenya Revenue Authority have been interdicted for abetting tax evasion and facilitating access to services through corruption. 61 are from Domestic Taxes Department and 14 are from Customs and Border Control Department. The Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji said the suspects are part and parcel of a criminal enterprise aimed at denying the country the much-needed revenue. Their activities according to investigative authorities have occasioned a reduction in tax collected by KRA. “ These are officers in senior and middle-level management, and therefore hold positions of trust on behalf of the people of Kenya,” the DPP said in a statement. Noting that there was considerable evidence to nail the culprits, the DPP charged that by their criminal conduct, they have betrayed the public trust bestowed upon them and the institution of KRA. “ The practices in question include facilitation of fraudulent clearance of cargo, fraudulent amendment of tax returns so as to help taxpayers evade taxes and the irregular issuance of Tax Compliance Certificates,” KRA said in a statement. In a statement, KRA said the arrests follow a fourmonth investigation in collaboration with law enforcement agencies that involved trailing money and communication to curb evasion of taxes and tax liability. 62 of the staff are based in Nairobi. The suspects will be arraigned in court this month. “ The officers affected have been detained for questioning and statement recording, prior to their arraignment in court, expected to happen within May 2019,” a statement by KRA Commissioner General read.
