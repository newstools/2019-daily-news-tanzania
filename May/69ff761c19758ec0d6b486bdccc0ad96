OVER 100 golfers from all clubs have confirmed to participate in the Lugalo Open, the 36-hole tournament to be held in Dar es Salaam this weekend. The three-day golf competition is scheduled to tee off on Friday and wind up on Sunday at the par 72 Tanzania People’s Defence Forces (TPDF) Lugalo course of Dar es Salaam. As unveiled by the club’s chairman Michael Luwongo to the media yesterday, the preparation for the national level competition is on a top gear, though much of its depends on the weather. Luwongo said that they are happy to have TANAPA (Tanzania National Parks) on the bandwagon as the event’s title sponsor for the second consecutive years. “Everything is going fine; the response is good as there are over 100 golfers already registered. We expect more to join us before Thursday evening set as a registration deadline,” he said. According to the chairman, this year’s event will be graced by the Deputy Minister for Information, Culture, Arts and Sports Juliana Shonza who will also award the best golfers during a closing ceremony on Sunday. Luwongo, however, expressed worries over the state of the course at this time of downpour as it might make it hard to play. Speaking on behalf of TANAPA, the authority’s Liaison Officer in charge Dar es Salaam office Dattomax Sellanyika, said they have decided to continue supporting the game because it is one of the popular games that also play a big role in promoting tourism. “We understand that golf is one of the game that attracts many people in the world, we want to use the competition to bring golfers together and make them aware of our vast tourist attractions,” he said.
