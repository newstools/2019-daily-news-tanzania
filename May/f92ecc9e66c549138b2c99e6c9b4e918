THE government has signed contracts worth 15.6bn/- with India-based consultancy organisation Water and Power Consultancy Services Limited (WAPCOS) for implementation of water projects in 29 towns. According to a statement issued here on Tuesday by the Communications Unit of the Water Ministry, the goal of the contract is to prepare detailed designs for all the projects. “WAPCOS Limited will prepare detailed designs which will include water sources available in all 29 towns and documents for the tender process,” reads part of the statement. The contract signing ceremony was held on Tuesday, the officials involved being the ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Prof Kitila Mkumbo and the Resident Manager for WAPCOS Limited, Mr Chandrasekhar Kombathula. Prof Kitila said two million people will benefit, pointing out that WAPCOS is carrying out the project thanks to soft loans from the government of India through Exim Bank of India. “WAPCOS should complete the work within two months after signing the contract today. Contractors who will execute the water projects should be at project sites by September,” said the Permanent Secretary. The projects are part of ongoing efforts by the government to attain its target of ensuring that 85 per cent of people in rural areas and 90 per cent of people in urban areas get access to water services by 2020.
