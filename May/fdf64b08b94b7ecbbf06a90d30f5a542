POLICE in Dar es Salaam are holding nine people for questioning after being arrested while vandalising Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO) infrastructures. The nine are further being accused of stealing oil from TANESCO’s transformers in different parts of the city. Speaking to reporters yesterday, the Dar es Salaam Special Zone Police Commander, Mr Lazaro Mambosasa said the suspects were arrested in an operation that was being conducted by police in collaboration with the TANESCO’s officers. He said the suspects were arrested while in the act of refilling the stolen fuel into containers that were stamped with brands of other companies. He named one as Shukuru Hamis (39), who was arrested at TANESCO’s Warehouse in Kigamboni area at night of Thursday last week, adding that on being cornered he mentioned his accomplices as Witness Elimansia (35), Yusuph Salum (38), Shaban Juma (38) and Mwamudu Ramadhani (39). “In the preliminary interrogation, the suspects admitted that they have been stealing oil from TANESCO’s transformers and selling it to their suppliers identified as Seleman Mrutu and Praygod Kimaro,” said Mambosasa. He added that the Police officers went to the Warehouse owned by the suspects, Kimario and Mrutu located at Tabata ‘Dampo’ area, but they managed to escape. The police and TANESCO’s officers found 68 containers of 20-litres of transformer oil and two barrel of 200-litres full of the transformer’s oil. However, he said police have launched a manhunt for them and once arrested they will appear in court after the completion of investigation. Reached for a comment, the TANESCO’s Security Manager, Mr Maxmillian Birigi is appealing to the general public to cooperate with them and Police to arrest the suspects and report any incident that involves theft and sabotage of their company’s infrastructures.
