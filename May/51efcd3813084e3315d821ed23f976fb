ASPIRANT for Young Africans Chairman post Mshindo Msolla launched his campaign yesterday, ahead of the Sunday’s General Election. Msolla, who is a professional football manager and had trained the national senior team, Taifa Stars in 2002 and 2003 has come up with five major priorities aimed at restructuring the club, one of the oldest in the country’s history. “I’ve stepped in to contest for the top post at Yanga because I believe that I possess all the qualities needed for the post after being involved in football activities for at least four folds,” Msolla said. Highlighting his priorities, Msolla said some of the major objectives for him if elected, will be to bring back the much needed unity and harmony at the club. He also pledged, if elected, he will bring back the club’s ownership to members by strengthening the existing club’s branches as well as establish new ones. “I will make sure that unity prevails at the club and that every member and fan will have the right to effectively participate in protecting the club’s constitution,” he said. “If elected, my leadership will work tirelessly to strengthen club branches across the country and open new ones,” he said, adding that he will also maintain the existing efforts by fans and members to contribute funds to help run the club affairs. He said the move will help the club to be self-reliant. Msolla pointed out his second priority as to spearhead the club’s transformation as stipulated in Article 56 of the club’s constitution, as amended in 2010. He also assured members that his third priority will be to make sure that the envisaged club’s projects including the development of Kaunda Stadium and renovation of the club house will be developed. “I will make sure that projects established by the club are developed as well as to establish new others,” he promised.
