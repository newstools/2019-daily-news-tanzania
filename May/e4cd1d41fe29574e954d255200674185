PRIME Minister, Kassim Majaliwa has hailed NMB Bank as exemplary in provision of banking services and for having deep roots in rural areas. Speaking at an Iftar organised by the bank for its clients in Dodoma over the weekend, the premier said the bank was a model in provision of good banking services and worth emulating for efforts to reach out to the unbanked rural population. “It is not sin when I say you’re leading in providing good financial services. I thank you for supporting institutions such as schools where you have provided desks and text books. I am pleased to hear you have begun to support sports activities. I congratulate you. We will continue to encourage you wherever you are,” he said. He said the bank has been helping the government in its efforts to develop various projects in the communities. He said that the government which is among shareholders of the bank would support it in its efforts to serve the public and tasked them to further improve their services in areas it has not reached. Former Premier Mizengo Pinda asked the bank to promote their loans products to farmers who constitute more than three-fourths of the population. He said he was one of beneficiaries of NMB loans which he use for agricultural activities where bank officers visit him and advise him on special loans for farmers. NMB bank Managing Director, Albert Jonkergouw said they organized the Iftar for its clients as a gesture to show appreciation for their loyalty and trust.
