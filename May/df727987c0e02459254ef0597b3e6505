SIMBA FC striker Meddie Kagere is undisputed the owner of the Mainland Premier League’s golden boot with 23 goals to his account. Kagere failed to score yesterday when hosts Mtibwa Sugar held Simba to a barren draw in the final league match held at Jamhuri Stadium in Morogoro. Still, despite missing the 26-goal record set by Mohamed Hussein ‘Mmachinga’, Kagere had, however, walked out as the league’s top scorer who had the given the 26- goal record the best ever chase. Did he net a hat-trick during his team’s final league match against Mtibwa Sugar; Kagere could have broken the 26-goal record that remained for a long time unbroken. Kagere, who had netted 23 goals prior to the yesterday’s last match against Mtibwa Sugar, needed a hat-trick to equal that record. Simba faced Mtibwa Sugar in a pride-restoration match as they are already assured the championship title while it didn’t threaten Mtibwa who have already passed the relegation danger zone. Kagere looked clear favourite to break the record as he had already claimed 22 goals with two matches in hand. Still Kagere's 23-goal achievement has already awarded him a golden boot despite failing to knock down Hussein’s long lived record. Furthermore, Kagere also shattered the last season's 20- goal League record which was being held by his striking partner Emmanuel Okwi. But he was a goal short to Abdallah Juma record of 24 goals. Also had the best league season include his partners Emanuel Okwi and John Bocco with 15 and 16 goals each. Young Africans striker Haritier Makambo who scored 17 goals was the second best in the topfive position. He has tied with Salim Ayei of Mwadui also with 17 goals.
