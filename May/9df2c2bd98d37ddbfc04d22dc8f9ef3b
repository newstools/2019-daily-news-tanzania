THE government has been advised to strengthen the citizen centered Beach Management Unit (BMU), along the 1,440 KM long Indian Ocean coastline for sustainable conservation and promotion of environmental friendly fishing to benefit current and future generations. The advice was given by Dr Jason John, from the department of Zoology and Wildlife Conservation of the University of Dar es salaam (UDSM), recently when talking with the ‘Daily News’ “The 2012 census suggests that over 22 percent of the country’s population dwells and are engaged in various economic activities around Indian Ocean coastline where Dar es Salaam and Tanga regions accommodates a big part of the population which goes in hand with serious implications on environment and marine ecosystems,” he said. He said that the government’s decision of establishing BMU units which are run by the people themselves was vital and needs to be promoted so as to allow sustainable access of the resources for common end and combating illegal activities. “Shoddy harbors, using poison in fishing, managing plastic waste and arbitrary felling of trees will be well combated if the authorities embark of strengthening BMUs to managing the population attracting coastline and promote tourism“. Dr John cited an example that the influx of domestic animals at the seaside of Lindi Region amid uncontrolled system was a threat to the biodiversity conservation while illegal fishing was a threat to marine ecosystem and to promotion of fishing activities and to the introduction of related fish processing companies.
