THE Agricultural Markets Development Trust (AMDT) has said its plan to set up comprehensive marketing systems will boost incomes and employment opportunities to all Tanzanians involved in agriculture especially those in rural areas. The market systems to be established will help in addressing current challenges experienced by farmers in the past markets developing initiatives. The AMDT Business Development Expert, Tertula Swai said here over the weekend that the new marketing systems will include seed production system, supply chain input and services delivery systems. “The market systems not only improve the marketing systems but also in addressing other challenges that would be experienced in improving the initiatives,” he said at a meeting organised here to discuss and deliberate on business improvements efforts by the government and the private sector. The meeting brought together leaders from the Southern Highlands under the programme for Agricultural Market Development. He said the plan for setting up improved marketing systems involves improved value chain for maize, legumes and sunflower and improve the business environment. Mbeya Regional Commissioner (RC), Albert Chalamila told the meeting that the current tax systems should be reformed to reflect current needs. “There is a need of reforming the tax regime so that it reflects current needs. The current tax systems regime was still in the 1990s,” he said.
