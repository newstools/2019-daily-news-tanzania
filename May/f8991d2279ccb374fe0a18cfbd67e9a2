KAGERA Regional Commissioner (RC), Brig Gen Marco Gaguti has directed leaders of Agricultural and Marketing Cooperative Societies (AMCOS) to intensify efforts on coffee production in the area, so that farmers also increase yields. Brig Gaguti made the appeal, while opening Kagera Cooperative Union (KCU) 20th general meeting, yesterday at Bukoba Municipality. While reading a speech, Mr Projestus Rubanzibwa on behalf of the RC, he also appealed to Tanzania Coffee Research Institute (TACRI) at Maruku area to ensure that they raise the coffee varieties’ yields and distribute them to the farmers in the coming planting season. Brig Gaguti pointed out that the region has all the potential to increase its coffee production, taking into consideration that it has plenty of rains and fertile soils. “Extension Officers should visit the farmers and give them the needed advice. Most of the coffee trees are now very old, aged about 60 years and do not guarantee yields again,” he added. In another related development, the RC tasked the leaders to ensure that smuggling of the crop to neighbouring country is stopped. He directed, however, that starting this season coffee, auction will be centralized in the region to avoid rampant thefts, which force the farmers to accept low prices. He also allowed the private sector to participate in the auction and buy the crop at competitive prices. However, for quite a long time the region’s farmers have not been getting favourable prices for the crop, because of various factors including rampant thefts by in-between middlemen connecting them to the markets and low payments. Kagera Region is one of the many areas whose populations rely on farming of both cash and food crops for a living.
