YOUNG Africans face an uphill task today as they take on Lipuli FC in the second semifinal of the Azam Sports Federation Cup (ASFC) at Samora Stadium in Iringa. The winner in today’s battle will play against Azam FC who were the first side to step into the final after a hard earned 1-0 victory over KMC at Azam Complex on Friday. Azam’s Zimbabwean import Donald Ngoma fired the only goal of the game which separated the two teams in the 73rd minute as they aim to make a history of winning the title two times. Both sides displayed mature and attractive football with debutants KMC always looking sharp to upset the hosts on the day but the final output was not friendly to them as such, they must wait for the next time. It was not a surprising thing though that after the tie, Azam captain Aggrey Morris decorated KMC saying if all the teams in the unfolding league were playing like them, the level of football in the country could have gone far ahead. Until now, no team has won the ASFC twice since all the past four winners; Yanga, Simba, Azam and the current holders Mtibwa Sugar have each clinched it once. Definitely, it is going to be an explosive match bearing in mind that the two teams will take this as the only chance to add silverware to their cup boards. Despite the fact that the Jangwani Street giants are topping the Mainland Premier League table, the opportunity to claim the title seems narrow since they have four games to play while the second place occupants Simba have nine encounters before finishing the campaign. However, of late, Samora Stadium has never been a friendly venue for Yanga bearing in mind that they posted their third league defeat of the season after downing 1-0 as such; nightmares are still afresh for the visitors. For Lipuli, they would want to foster their good performance in the ASFC and play lungs out to reach at the finishing line for the first time ever.
