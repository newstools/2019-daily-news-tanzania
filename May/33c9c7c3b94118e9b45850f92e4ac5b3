WEIGHTS and Measures Agency (WMA) is set to fix electrified meters and their verification in the public in the next fiscal year, it was disclosed in Dar es Salaam yesterday. The Agency’s Technical Director, Ms Stella Kahwa made the revelation, while presiding over the Weights and Measures’ International Day, adding that the government has already released permits for such operations and preparations are in final stage. “We remind the general public to obey the laws, because the Agency would not hesitate to take legal measures against anyone found tampering with the devices. The set punishment for offenders is 100,000/- to 20m/- penalty or jail sentence, or both punishments at once,” she said. Ms Kahwa further said that retributions would not be imposed on those meddling with meters only, but anyone who would be caught tampering with any other kind of weight and measurement devices, be it in agriculture, transportation or health among others. She pointed out that commemoration week that started on 14th this month, has seen WMA succeed in verifying small and large weighing devices in various markets. She singled spots like various Petrol Stations to make sure that their fuel pumps are functioning and perfect so that their customers are not cheated in the meters. In small and medium factories, according to the Director, WMA verified the weight, capacity, length, width as well as to ascertain that their goods have quality in line with the customers’ demand.
