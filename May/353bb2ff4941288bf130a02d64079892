THE government has instructed teachers in public primary and secondary schools countrywide to refrain from demanding for arrears of annual salary increment for years that there was no increment of salary for public servants. Deputy Minister in the President’s Office (Regional Administration and Local Government), Mr Mwita Waitara, made the instructions in the National Assembly yesterday when responding to a question by Special Seats MP, Ms Zainab Bakar (CHADEMA). Ms Bakar had claimed that teachers in public schools are entitled for annual salary increment and sought to know whether they will be paid arrears for the past four years since there has not been any salary increment for the period. In response, Mr Waitara explained that the government has put in place guidelines for annual salary increment based on performance of teachers and other public servants in central and local government authorities. The deputy minister explained that Regulation number E. 9 (1) of Public Service Act of 2009 guides the government on annual salary increment for public servants based on budget policy of the respective financial year. “It should thus be understood that civil servants, including teachers in public service, receive increment when the wage bill allows,” he explained. Mr Waitara admitted that on the other hand, the government was not able to increase salaries due to budget constraints during fiscal years 2003/2004, 2004/2005, 2008/2009, 2011/2012, 2012/2013 and 2016/2017. “Nevertheless, given the good performance of civil servants, the fifth phase government increased salaries during financial year 2017/2018. Let me assure this august House that the government will increase salaries when the wage bill allows,” he stated.
