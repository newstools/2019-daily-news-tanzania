DODOMA City Council has warned residents to be cautious against unauthorised companies that purport to have plots for sale, saying potential clients should contact City Council authorities. The City Council pointed out in a press statement issued here yesterday that the authority had learnt that several companies had been circulating plot selling advertisements. “The City Council is cautioning individuals wishing to purchase plots not to deal with the companies to avoid inconveniences,” read part of the statement which was signed by the Council’s Communication Officer, Mr Ramadhani Juma. It explained that the City Council Director invites companies wishing to undertake plot surveys in Dodoma to follow procedures, noting that the City Council was willing to cooperate with development partners in developing the urban centre. Meanwhile, the City Council Director, Mr Godwin Kunambi, has formed a tenmember team to cooperate with the council’s lawyer to review the draft constitution of a petty traders’ association at the famous Sabasaba Market in the city centre. Mr Kunambi formed the team after the suspension of its Chairperson, Mr Athumani Makole, over alleged embezzlement of the association’s funds. He said whatever subsequent decisions he would make would be based on the team’s findings and recommendations.
