THE upcoming civic polls planned for November 24, this year, are set to be conducted peacefully, the Minister of State in the President’s Office, Regional Administration and Local Governments, Mr Selemani Jafo, has assured. He gave the assurance yesterday when addressing Regional Administrative Secretaries (RAS) from all 26- regions. The minister said preparations for the polls were being undertaken meticulously, by initially ensuring that the set of rules and regulations governing them were being adhered to. Mr Jafo added that the regulations, which were proposed by election experts, would be scrupulously enforced by officials who include district executive directors, RAS and finally regional commissioners. “These regulations involved all parties and stakeholders since we wanted to have the best and their formulation has followed a special system that was not used before,” said Mr Jafo. He was optimistic that the civic polls will be conducted peacefully, taking into account that their preparations had involved all parties with common goals. Mr Jafo further explained that other stakeholders involved in coming up with the regulations were political parties with permanent registration and civic society organizations. The last civic polls were held in December 2014, the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) emerging overall winner, followed by Chadema, Civic United Front (CUF) and NCCR-Mageuzi.
