A TOTAL of 331 people here have completed a three-month marriage course, and now qualify them to marry, the Minister for Constitution and Legal Affairs, Mr Khamis Juma Mwalim has said. He said since the course was introduced about two-years ago, many young people mainly from Pemba Island have developed interest in attending it, because it guarantees them marriage. Religious affairs’ course is under the Ministry, and it prepares couples intending to marry, especially those who have been in engagement. “The class is designed for those who want to give their marriage the best possible start, whether they’re experiencing marriage for the first time or have been married before. We aim at minimizing marriage break-ups or divorce,” Mwalim said. Facilitators of the course including Sheikh Muhhidin Zubeir said that the program being run under Muftis Office is also issuing them with certificates as a requirement in marriage, adding that that all future engaging couples should pass through the training. After arguably long period of increased divorces in Zanzibar, activists and the government have been taking different measures to protect marriage, including organizing awareness programmes on marriage as well as strengthening laws on it and family. Earlier announcement by Mjini-Magharib Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr Ayoub Mohamed Mahmoud, that youth planning to get marriage should see him for bride price was another step in trying to minimize conflicts which result into divorce. B ride price also known as bride wealth or marriage payment is payment made by a bridegroom (expected new husband), or his kin to the kin of the bride (woman who is about to get married) in order to ratify a marriage. It is practiced in different ways backed by different culture and religions in the Island.
