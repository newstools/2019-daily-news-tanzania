Tanzanian business tycoon and Media mogul Reginald Mengi has passed away in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, the IPP Media outlets have reported. Mengi, 75, who was also the Chairman of the IPP Group of Companies and owner of various businesses in and outside the country died early Thursday and no more updates of his death have been released so far. The IPP Group describes Dr Mengi as a prominent philanthropist who has pioneered corporate and individual social responsibility in Tanzania “by contributing his time and resources to worthy causes.” Despite being born into extreme poverty, the IPP website describes, Dr Reginald Mengi managed to study accountancy in the UK and qualified as a chartered accountant. In 1989 Dr Mengi left the prestigious audit firm of Cooper Brothers (later Coopers & Lybrand and now PriceWaterHouseCoopers- PWC), where he had risen to the position of Managing Partner and Chairman, to concentrate on his own businesses. He wrote an inspiring book titled ‘I CAN, I MUST, I WILL: The Spirit of Success’ which was launched by President John Magufuli at the State House in Dar es Salaam.
