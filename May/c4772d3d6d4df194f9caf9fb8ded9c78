THE government has signed two grant agreements amounting 330bn/- with the Federal Republic of Germany for financing an ambitious climate resilience project, which aims at ending water woes in five districts in Simiyu Region. Such financing will be extended to the government by Germany and the Green Climate Fund (GCF) through German Development Bank (KfW) and will be implemented by the Ministry of Water. Addressing reporters during the signing of the agreement in Dar es Salaam yesterday, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Finance and Planning Doto James said the project aims at supplying water from Lake Victoria to the five districts - Busega, Bariadi, Itimila, Maswa and Meatu. According to him, the project will focus on enhancing the ability of the population to deal with the impacts of climate change through the financing of sustainable water supply systems, sanitation measures and enhance agricultural practices to make farming more resilient. He pointed out that the assistance had come at the right time since available resources, ground and surface water sources in the entire Simiyu Region were generally insufficient in quantity and quality as the only reliable water source was Lake Victoria. "The Simiyu project will complement government efforts to enhance water supply and reach the target of 85 per cent in rural areas and 95 per cent in urban areas by 2020. Based on the importance attached to the project, the PS noted that the government would provide €40.7m (about 104.1bn/)- as counterpart funds, while beneficiaries will also contribute €1.5m (about 3.8bn/-). The PS commended GCF and the Federal Republic of Germany for extending the two grants. KFW Director of East Africa, DRC and African Union, Dr Klaus Müller, noted the funding was the largest green funding project, which
