REGIONAL Commissioners (RCs) countrywide have been advised to embrace the ban on plastic bags as an opportunity to set up factories for manufacture of environmentallyfriendly bags. The advice was given here yesterday by the Minister of State in the President’s Office, Regional Administration and Local Government, Mr Selemani Jafo, saying the RCs should set up an agenda for the mission. Moreover, the RCs were directed to ensure they fully implement the government ban on the use and importations of plastic bags, effective June 1, 2019. The minister said the setup of factories for alternative bags apart from creating jobs to people in their respective areas, will also avail the public with the products for their use. “It is high time you sensitised people in your respective areas to come up with alternative bags that are environmentally friendly to replace the plastic bags whose uses end on June 1, this year,” said the minister. He said the sensitisation and mobilisation tasks can be well executed by the RCs through initiation of special campaigns for small-scale, medium and large-scale industries to meet the market demand. “If you can remember our 12-month campaign that each region must construct 100 small, medium or large scale industries and our target was to have in place 2,600 industries but at the end of the campaign we had 4,887, let us emulate the spirit,” said Mr Jafo. He added, “Let us take the ban on plastic use as an opportunity to set up industries for alternative bags in our areas to create jobs and open more economic avenues for our people.” Mr Jafo said the RCs did a commendable job in joining the government efforts during the ban on the packaging of alcohol in sachets, commonly known as ‘viroba’, saying the same efforts should be applied on plastics.
