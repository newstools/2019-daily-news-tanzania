NATIONAL Assembly Speaker Job Ndugai has asked Tanzanians who are yet to acquire their National Identity Cards (IDs) to do so immediately so that they can register their SIM Cards through the Biometric Registration. He gave the advice on Tuesday after visiting various mobile phone companies to register his Sim Cards at Bunge grounds at an exercise that was also attended by Deputy Minister of Works, Transport and Communications Engineer Atashasta Nditiye and Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) Director General James Kilaba. Speaking after the Biometric Registration, Mr Ndugai described the exercise as important for the country’s security as well as reducing cybercrime. “I request all Tanzanians to register because the exercise does not take time, it takes not less than three minutes to accomplish registration.” Speaking at the occasion, Engineer Nditiye said after the mobile phone companies brought the service at Bunge grounds, many MPs had registered their SIM Cards, paying tribute to the Speaker Ndugai for leading by example. He further thanked the telecom companies for bringing the services closer to people. Tanzanians have until December 30, 2019 to go for biometric SIM Cards registration, according to the deputy minister who further insisted that in September, the government will conduct an assessment of the exercise. “So far the exercise is running smoothly and we are glad that many people are turning up in big numbers for the exercise,’’ said Engineer Nditiye.
