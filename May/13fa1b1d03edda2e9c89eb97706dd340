TANZANIA plans to set up gauging stations on all rivers that are tributaries of Mara River, an official with the ministry of water and irrigation said yesterday. The rivers are Tigithe, Somoche and Tobora. “The gauging stations will be telling us the trend of water level on the rivers,” Mara-Mori Water Catchment Officer Mwita Mataro told the ‘Daily News’ here on Thursday. Lake Victoria Basin Water Body, which is under the ministry of water, is expected to build the gauging stations in this fiscal year, according to the official. Mr Mataro said all the three rivers are still flowing into Mara River despite ongoing challenges associated with human activities like agriculture, deforestation and traditional livestock keeping around the rivers. “Mara River water level is also improving due to the ongoing rains,” Mr Mataro who also works under Lake Victoria Basin Water Body Office which is responsible for protection of the health of Mara River, said. Mara River is a transboundary river which runs through Masai Mara Game Reserves in Kenya and Serengeti National Park (SENAPA) in Tanzania before flowing into Lake Victoria on the Tanzanian side. Recently, Kenyan media reported that Mara River tributaries on the Kenyan side are drying up, blaming sand harvesting, deforestation and climate change. The two countries have been engaged in numerous projects that seek to protect and conserve Mara River basin Besides having significant contribution on conservation of the Serengeti- Masai Mara ecosystem, Mara River basin also supports livelihood of about 1.1 million people in the two East Africa countries.
