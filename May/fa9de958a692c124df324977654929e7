TANZANIA Association of Employers (ATE) has requested the government to continue improving the business environment to attract more local and foreign investors and boost the country’s economy through investment sector. Speaking yesterday during the international Workers Day (May Day), marked at the national level in Mbeya Region, ATE’s Chairperson, Ms Jayne Nyimbo said despite the government’s efforts in improving the country’s business environments but still employers are facing separate challenges including high cost of operating business. “Major among of the challenges is high cost of charges for Skills Development Levy (SDL) where by employers are charged 4.5 per cent. We request the government to reduce it to 2 per cent as well as to lower income tax,” she pleaded. The association also has requested the government to review and adjust the country’s laws and regulations of works and enable the laws to suit the business environment in order to support the increase of productivity and economic development for the national benefits. “The recent country’s work laws and regulations favour negligence, embezzlement and theft at workplaces. We employers as stakeholders would like to be involved and cooperate respectively in reviewing and adjusting these laws for the country’s benefits in order to boost accountability among the workers,” she said. ATE congratulated the President J ohn Magufuli for being on the frontline to fight against red tape by some government’s officers in issuing investment permits. According to ATE, the move by President Magufuli in fighting the scourge would help to restore investors trust in the government.
