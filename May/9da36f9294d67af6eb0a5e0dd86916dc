GURPAL Singh and his Zambian navigator Dave Sihoka from AESL Rally team had aimed for the first position in the recently held Vaisakhi Rally 2019, but they only hit the third spot. The duo are now re-targeting the top spot in the Tanzanian round of African Rally Championship (ARC) to be staged in Dar es Salaam in June. The team is currently reworking their machine, the Mitsubishi Evolution 10 ready to face the local and foreign challengers in the continental level event in Dar es Salaam five weeks from now; “I have been driving the Mitsubishi Evo for seven years now since 2012,” said Gurpal Singh . He is currently in the third position in the National Rally Championship (NRC) seeding points standings. Randeep Singh from Birdi Rally Team is leading the pack, while Tufail Tufail is holding the second position nationally. Tufail was the winner of Vaisakhi Rally, while Randeep finished second in the event which took place in Kilimanjaro Region two weeks ago. Motorists claim the road was bad and rocky causing a total of seven vehicles to break down and be taken off the competition. “The road was really challenging taking our team by surprise, because during the final lap, our tyre burst forcing us to drive on flat wheel for five kilometres, as if that wasn’t enough, the propeller shaft dropped from the chassis along the way, compelling the vehicle to move with differential hub locked until completing the route, otherwise the victory was ours,” said Gurpal. Gurpal appealed to organisers to be more considerate when drawing rally routes because it is very expensive to repair vehicles after driving on horrid tracks such as the Siha routes in the previous rally. “Servicing rally cars is expensive and arduous task, thus unless one has more than one equipment, drivers may miss other events while taking care of vehicles in case the competition dates are closer,” pointed out the motorist.
