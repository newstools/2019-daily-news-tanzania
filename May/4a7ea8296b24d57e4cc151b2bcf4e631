TIGO customers in Bariadi District in Simiyu Region can now enjoy access to 4G network after the operator launched an upgraded network site as part of its continued efforts to bring the best voice, internet and mobile money services to its customers. Speaking during the launch in Bariadi town, Tigo’s Territory Manager for Lake Zone, Gwamaka Mwakilembe, said here that upgrading the network site from 3G to 4G means that their customers in Bariadi will now have faster and easier access to their services. “It is the company’s priority to ensure that our customers get access to modern and state of the art technology such as 4G,” he said. He added, it is worth mentioning that, 4G technology has increased accessibility to mobile broadband, opening the rural communities to previously elusive services such as e-commerce, e-health, eeducation and e-government, eventually transforming the way people learn and do business,” The site launch also goes hand-in-hand with offers, whereas customers (in the 4G site) who swap their SIM cards to 4G will be awarded with 4GB free internet which they can use within seven days. Mwakilembe also reiterated Tigo’s commitment to support the National ICT policy and government’s industrialization efforts by investing in network expansion and improvement to enable the entire country to experience the wide array of economic, educational and social advantages that result from digital connectivity. This site launch in Bariadi is the second upgraded site launch taking place in a countrywide campaign where 52 new and revamped network sites from Tigo will be launched countrywide throughout the Coastal, South, North and Lake Zones of Tanzania. Other sites from the Lake Zone that have been upgraded and will launch soon apart from Bariadi include those in Butiama, Musoma and Mtukula, Kagera.
