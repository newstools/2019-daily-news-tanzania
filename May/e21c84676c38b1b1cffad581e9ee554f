OVER 9,000 villages in the country will be connected to electricity by July next year through the rural electrification projects, Deputy Minister for Energy, Ms Subira Mgalu, told the National Assembly on Wednesday. The government of Tanzania is currently implementing phase three of rural energy projects through the Rural Energy Agency (REA). The initial two phases of the projects have already benefited a number of villages across the country. Ms Mgalu made the explanation when responding to a supplementary question by Tarime Urban MP, Ms Esther Matiko, who had complained that a number of villages in her constituencies have not benefited from the electrification projects. Earlier, the Deputy Minister told the august House that a total of 644m/- had been used to supply electricity to initial 275 customers in Tunduru South constituency through REA projects. She gave the explanation in response to a basic question by Tunduru South MP, Mr Daimu Mpakate (CCM), who complained that only four out of 65 villages in the constituency were covered during the first and second phases of REA projects. Ms Mgalu told the MP that apart from the four villages, additional four villages will be connected during the ongoing stage one of phase three whose execution is expected to be completed by June, next year. â€œImplementation of the project in Tunduru included construction of 33 kilovolts of power line covering 9.4 kilometers as well as construction of 0.4 kilovolts covering a distance of eight kilometers as well as installation of four transformers, each with a capacity of Kva50. She said the remaining 57 villages will be covered through stage two of phase three which is slated to be executed between July 2020 and June 2021.
