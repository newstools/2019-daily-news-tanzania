ROAD accidents along Sukumahela at Mbwasa area, Manyoni and Sekenke- Shelui claimed the lives of 33 and injured 26 people in 28 accidents which occurred between January 2016 and December 2017, the National Assembly was told yesterday. Deputy Minister for Home Affairs, Engineer Hamad Masauni, made the revelation when responding to a basic question by Manyoni East MP, Mr Daniel Mtuka (CCM). The MP had tasked the government to release figures of fatalities and injuries caused by road accidents along Sukumahela hills at Mbwasa-Manyoni and Sekenke-Shelui. Mr Mtuka also wanted the government to explain measures it has put in place to curb road carnage along the highway, particularly in Singida Region. Responding, Eng Masauni urged drivers and members of the pubic to adhere to road safety rules and legislations by taking consideration of all roads. The Deputy Minister cited major causes of road accidents as negligence and fatigue by some drivers, steep slopes, sharp corners and rundown vehicles, among others. However, the MP was apparently not satisfied by the response, and urged the government to conduct a study on the major causes of accidents along the stretch of the central highway. In response, Deputy Minister for Works, Transport and Communications, Eng Elias Kwandikwa, informed the MP that the area in question experienced more accidents even before the road was constructed to bitumen level. Eng Kwandikwa nevertheless told the House that the government will undertake a study at the stretch of the road and come up with solutions for recurring accidents which claim lives of people and destruction of property.
