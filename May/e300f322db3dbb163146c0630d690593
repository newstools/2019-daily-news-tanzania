WITH less than a week to the deadline imposed on plastic bags (Marlboro) in Tanzania, the Kilimanjaro Regional Commissioner (RC) Ms Anna Mghwira said the region was ready to implement the government’s directive. In an exclusive interview with the “Daily News” in Moshi recently, Ms Mghwira said the region was proud of ready manufacturers of friendly environmental alternative bags giving further assurance that their residents are willing to comply come June 1, 2019. “May I take this opportunity to appeal to all wananchi within Kilimanjaro Region to abide with the government’s directive on the ban and start using friendly environmental bags, which lucky enough are manufactured in our midst,’ she pointed out. Equally, the RC urged religious leaders as well as other government administrators in all levels of authority within the region to continue raising awareness on the ban, while at the same time mobilising them to use the eco-friendly carrier bags to avoid unnecessary inconveniences. In relation to that, Harsho Group Managing Director, Mr Harold Shoo, who is one of the manufacturers of the friendly environmental carrier bags assured Ms Mghwira that his company, as well as others have already started producing the new ecofriendly packaging materials before ban takes effect. “We are currently producing between 200,000 and 300,000 of all types and sizes of environmental friendly carrier bags in every 24 hours”, he pointed out, adding that the products would be able to satisfy the public demands as alternative. He further said: “People should not have any doubt because we manufacture carrier bags of all sizes demanded by the market with our ex-factory prices ranging between 60/- per piece to 360/- per piece, depending on the size.” However, Mr Shoo urged the government through relevant authorities to make sure that new imported friendly environmental bags are subjected to the required local standards. “The ban of plastic bags in the country will obviously come with new business opportunities, and this may include importation of new Eco-friendly carrier bags, hence I appeal to authorities like TBS, NEMC and others to check out their standards to save the local market from counterfeit products, something which will make sure that our clients are safe”, he said.
