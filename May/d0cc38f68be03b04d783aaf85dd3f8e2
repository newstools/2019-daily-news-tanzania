TANZANIA Breweries Limited (TBL) has reinstated its commitment to collaborate and empower farmers in the use of latest technology to improve barley productivity in the country. Last year the company bought 13,000 tonnes from local barley farmers and paid them 12bn/-. Barley Manager at TBL, Joel Msechu, said in Arusha yesterday that, the brewer introduced new varieties of seed to help farmers grow commercial barley suitable to the soil and climatic conditions of Tanzania. The initiative also extended to introduce AB InBev’s global programme ‘Smart Barley’ to the farmers, which aimed at transforming agriculture by leveraging data, technology and insights to help growers solve challenges and improve their productivity, livelihoods and environmental performance. Mr Msechu, encouraged farmers to adopt the latest farming technology and practices for better productivity and promised that the company will continue to empower farmers in the country. “With an aim to empower farmers, offer them with enough input and information to increase productivity while actively reducing environmental impact. “We are strongly committed to productivity while actively reducing environmental impact,” Mr Msechu said. Local sourcing is a core part of TBL’s strategy and by adding depth to Tanzania’s agricultural sector, the group continues to play its part in furthering the rural economy’s development and the livelihoods of those who depend on agriculture as their main source of income. Commenting on programme, Head of Barley Farmers Association in Arusha region zone, Bariki Kivuyo, on behalf of other farmers said the programme has given them an opportunity to earn a decent livelihood. “The support and inputs given to us farmers have helped increase our yield,” Mr Kivuyo said.
