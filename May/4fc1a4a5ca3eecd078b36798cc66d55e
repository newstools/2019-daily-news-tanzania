THE Netherlands-based IHE Delft Institute for Water Education is conducting Environmental Flow Assessment (EFA) on the Tanzanian side on the Mara River Basin. IHE Delft is the world’s largest international graduate water education facility. Among other things, it will look at the quality of water, quantity and living organisms like fish species with the aim of developing water allocation plan. Government experts from the Ministry of Water, Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute (TAFIRI), Lake Victoria Water Basin and Mara-Mori River Catchment are participating in the exercise which was set in motion early this week. “The objective of the EFA is to develop a water allocation plan in Tanzania’s Mara River Basin”, Mr Ogoma Mangasa , a hydrologist from Lake Victoria Water Basin Body Office told the ‘ Daily News’ in Tarime . The EFA will establish the water needed for environment and basic human needs. The team of experts conducting the EFA is led by Ms Lauren Zielinski from IHE Delft Water Science and Engineering Department who is the project coordinator. This is reportedly the first and high profile EFA to be conducted on Tanzania’s side of the Mara River Basin, thanks to GIZ and other partners supporting the initiative. Mara River is a transboundary river which runs through Masai Mara Game Reserve in Kenya and Serengeti National Park (SENAPA) in Tanzania before flowing into Lake Victoria on the Tanzanian side. Besides having significant contribution on conservation of the Serengeti- Masai Mara ecosystem, the Mara River basin also supports livelihood of about 1.1 million people in Tanzania and Kenya However, increased human activities that include intensive agriculture, deforestation, sand harvesting and livestock keeping are threatening the survival of the river basin covering 13,750 square kilometres. Kenyan media recently reported that Mara River tributaries on the Kenyan side were drying up.
