THE second Vice President Ambassador Seif Ali Iddi has said that Zanzibar is on track to achieve ‘Middle Income’ economy soon, and appealed to its citizens and public servants to remain committed to work hard. “The individual Per capita income (PCI) is almost reaching that of the middle income country, and we have managed to control inflation and our economy growth is admirable, and expected to reach 7.8 per cent this year,” Mr Iddi said. That was part of his speech yesterday, while moving his office’s 54bn/- budget proposal for 2019/2020 fiscal year in day one that focused on the budget session of Zanzibar House of Representatives. He said social, economic and political changes in the country have been going on well. Ambassador Iddi attributed the ongoing development to prevailing peace and stability, adding that it has enabled tourism, investments to flourish in the Island, and hope for better future should the ‘Oil and Gas development’ bear fruits. He listed some showing improvements as the fishing industry, seaweed, trade, industrialisation, and increasing seas and land transportation, as well as ‘blue economy’, identifying them as other areas, whose development will change Zanzibar in the near future.
