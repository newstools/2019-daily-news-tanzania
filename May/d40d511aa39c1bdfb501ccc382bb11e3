BACKBENCHERS have said that frequent deaths and serious injuries realised as a result of roads accidents can be minimized to a great extent if roads are built with roads bumps in various areas in mind. Mr Yussuf Hassan Iddi (Fuoni) and Mr Mohamed Said Mohamed (Mpendae) asked the government not to be reluctant in mounting road bumps particularly in areas, where children and people with disability cross. “We have witnessed several times accidents due to reckless driving and vehicle over-speeding and children have died. It is high time bumps are constructed,” Mohamed said here yesterday, during questions and answer session of the House. In his reply, the deputy Minister for Infrastructure, Communication and Transport Mr Mohamed Ahmada Salum said: “We will consider your suggestions, but we need to discuss with our road safety experts on how and where to have the bumps built.”
