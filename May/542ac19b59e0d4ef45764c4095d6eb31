MEMBERS of the Zanzibar House of Representatives have commended the Regional Commissioner (RC) for Urban-West Region Mr Ayoub Mohamed Mahmoud for offering 'Bride Price' to any youth who wants to marry in his region. "Any youth who wants to marry but unable to pay bride wealth, should come to my office and see me for support. Any youth in my region is welcomed," Mr Mahmoud announced recently. The announcement, which went viral in the social media, was received with praise by many legislators such as Mr Mussa Ali Mussa (Ole) and Mr Suleiman Makame Ali (Ziwani) who also asked other RCs to support youth planning to marry. The legislators said that many young men here want to marry, but are hindered by lack of bride price, the reason also linked to increasing sexual abuse including rape and unplanned/forced marriage in the society. More married youth will reduce sexual abuse. Brice price also known as Bride wealth or marriage payment is payment made by a bridegroom (expected new Husband) or his kin to the kin of the bride (woman who is about to get married) in order to ratify a marriage. It is practiced in different ways backed by different culture and religions.
