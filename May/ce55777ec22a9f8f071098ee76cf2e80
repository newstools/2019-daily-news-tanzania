DEPUTY Minister for Works, Transport and Communications, Atashasta Nditiye, yesterday told Members of Parliament (MPs) at the National Assembly here yesterday that the government is carrying out a feasibility study on the construction of a 1, 092 kilometers railway network from Mtwara-Mbamba Bay- Mchuchuma-Liganga. He added that already the government has also identified a Consultant who is only waiting for a contract to be signed in June this year as an Adviser. Mr Nditiye further told the lawmakers that the adviser would be responsible for marketing the project to various investors. The project that runs from Mtwara to Mbamba Bay and branch out to Liganga and Mchuchuma mines will be implemented in form of Public Private Partnership (PPP). “We will start the construction activities immediately after obtaining a suitable investor,” he pointed out. The deputy minister further said: “As I speak the feasibility study and preliminary detailed design for the construction of the railway line is complete.” That was in his response to a question by Mtwara Rural lawmaker Hawa Ghasia (CCM), who sought to know when the construction of the railway line would start.
