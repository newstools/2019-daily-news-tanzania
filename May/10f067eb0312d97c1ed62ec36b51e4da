THE management of the Isles League champs KMKM unveiled a plan to reinforce the squad by recruiting four players who can serve well the team in the domestic league and the continental level assignments. KMKM who clinched Zanzibar Premier League title will represent the Isles in the CAF Champions League next season. Being in the level of the tournament, the management said the four players have been carefully studied before deciding to pick them. The team’s Head Coach, Ame Msimu told reporters here that the four players are needed to reinforce areas which seriously need reinforcement like defending and striking positions. “We intend to recruit four new players to reinforce our squad. We want players who fit in both domestic and international events like CAF Championship League,” he stressed. He named the positions that can be reinforced as striking force that needs two strikers, midfield section that needs one player and the defence line also needs one player. He said, strikers are urgently needed since they lacked a sharp striking despite winning the title. “It is too early to mention the names of the players we want and their former teams. But they will be made public after the end of the recruiting process,” he said. He added that registration talks are going on well and he hoped all process to end successfully before the start of the new season.
