KONGWA District in Dodoma Region has been designated at the centre of memorials of the liberation struggles against colonial rule in the southern African countries which were hosted in Tanzania, the National Assembly heard yesterday. Deputy Minister for Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, Ms Juliana Shonza, told the House yesterday that the government will construct infrastructure for historical conservation of the liberation struggles, including monuments of the founding father of Tanzania, the Late Mwalimu Julius Nyerere. Ms Shonza further informed legislators that the government of Tanzania jointly with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), have undertaken rehabilitation works of Tanzania Broadcasting Corporation (TBC) radio station. The deputy minister explained that the studio of the former Radio Tanzania Dar es Salaam (RTD) along Nyerere Road in Dar es Salaam acts as an exceptional centre for works of Mwalimu Nyerere. Ms Shonza made the remarks while responding to a basic question by Mtera MP, Mr Livingstone Lusinde, which was asked on his behalf by Special Seats MP, Ms Felister Bura. Mr Lusinde had queried as to why the government has not constructed memorials to preserve the works of Mwalimu Nyerere in Kongwa District which was among areas which hosted freedom fighters from a number of countries in the southern African countries during the liberation struggles. The MP argued that the memorials will act as tourist attractions for people within and outside the country. Ms Shonza explained that in recognition of the roles by the Late Mwalimu Nyerere and the first President of Zanzibar, the Late Sheikh Abeid Amani Karume, the government enacted a law in honour of the two leaders who united the then Tanganyika and Zanzibar to form the United Republic of Tanzania in 1964. She stated that the legislation stipulates establishment of memorials and centres to preserve the work of the two leaders.
