A NEWLY restructured Cashew nut Board of Tanzania (CBT) will soon be revealed, the National Assembly was told yesterday. Deputy Minister for Agriculture, Mr Omary Mgumba said the government was currently finalizing the process to restructure the board and the appointment of its members will be revealed by the appointing authorities within a short period of time, in accordance with the countryâ€™s constitution, laws and existing regulations. In October 26th last year, the government dissolved the board, which was then led by Acting Director General, Prof Wakuru Magigi, following a row that saw farmers boycott the cashew nut auctions. However, the deputy minister said it is not true that the activities of CBT, which was established by the Act 18 of 2009, are currently being handled by Cereals Mixed Crops Board (CMCB). Mr Mgumba said the major responsibility of CBT is to supervise, coordinate, regulate and develop production of cashew nuts in the country, including monitoring its production, processing and business in the sector. He said the Cereal and Mixed Crops Board was established by Act 19 of 2009 and it is carrying out its normal duties, which includes buying and selling mixed crops inside and outside the country. He said the only task which CMCB is doing is to coordinate sale of cashew nuts. The deputy minister said on April 15th this year, the Minister of Agriculture appointed acting Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of CBT and eight board members to serve for the next three years. He said the board chairman will soon be appointed by the appointing authorities. Mr Mgumba was responding to a basic question by Special Seats MP, Sikudhani Chikambo (CCM), who said since the government dissolved CBT, its activities have shifted to CMCB and demanded to know when the government will appoint a new boardto carry out its duties
