THE marathon budget session of the Zanzibar House of Representatives gets underway this morning as lawmakers are set to deliberate on the 2018/19 national budget. House Clerk, Ms Raya Issa Msellem revealed here that preparations are complete ahead of the two-month meeting, and urged Representatives to observe regulations. “Everything is in place for the August House, and I would like to urge all members of the House to observe the House rules and regulations, which include prohibiting unjustifiable absenteeism, late coming, and leaving before time,” Ms Msellem told a press conference. The House’s main deliberations will be debating and approving the Zanzibar national budget for the next fiscal year. Government ministries will present their financial estimations ahead of the main government budget. During the session, a total of 157 questions will be asked and answered, while the lawmakers will also debate and subsequently approve the finance bill, 2019. According to Ms Msellem, the House will also receive a special inquiry report on 19 poorly constructed school buildings. A section of Reps raised allegations of shoddy construction and successfully appealed for formation of a special committee to inquire into the multi-billion project. The commercialisation of motorbike taxis in Zanzibar is another issue that is scheduled to be presented and debated in the House. Despite their mushrooming across the Indian Ocean semi-autonomous, commercial motorcycle taxis are prohibited according to Zanzibar laws. But with the number of bodabodas growing rapidly in both urban and rural areas, the government of Zanzibar is apparently inclined into legalising the commercial operation of motorcyclists despite existing security and safety concerns. While motorcycles provide transportation options to the public and job opportunities to young people, their presence has resulted in an increase in road accidents, injuries and deaths.
