FORMATION of fathers’ groups has intensified the fight against Gender Based V iolence (GBV ) at Susuni and Mbogi wards in Tarime district, Mara region. “We have done a great work to curb GBV acts like female genital mutilation (FGM) and child marriages. The society is now recognising us,” Zakayo Mariko, a member of Susuni father’s group, told the ‘D aily News’ here yesterday. “There is a big change and some traditions, which are the root cause of GBV in our villages are almost ending,” Boazi Marwa from Mbogi ward fathers group said. The group members were speaking on the sidelines of a special training that brought together 30 members of Susuni and Mbogi wards fathers groups. The two-day training on Sexual Reproductive Health and Right (SRHR) was organised by Children’s Dignity Forum (CDF), a non-governmental organisation that executes various projects aiming at ending FGM, child marriages and teenage pregnancies in Tarime district. “So far, the fathers groups have been helpful and we have seen the importance of equipping them with SRHR knowledge to enable them help more people in their villages,” CDF Project Officer in Tarime, Juvitus Alphonce said. The trainers of the training came from the offices of Tarime Town Medical Officer (DMO) and Tarime/Roya Regional Police Zone Women and Child Gender Desk. Besides FGM and child marriages, the 30 men are also helping to tackle domestic and economic related violence issues in their wards. CDF came with fathers’ groups idea as part of its strategic plans to involve men in the ongoing battle against GBV acts that mostly affect the girl child and women in the district.
