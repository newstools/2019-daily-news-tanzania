YOUNG Africans Head Coach Mwinyi Zahera said lack of fast wingers in his squad deprived them an opportunity to score many goals on Monday against Azam FC. Yanga claimed maximum three points courtesy of a 1-0 victory over the third-placed Azam at the Uhuru Stadium in Dar es Salaam to reach 77 points at the peak of the Mainland Premier League. Mrisho Ngasa fired the only goal of the match in the first half, his first ever goal against Azam and his fifth of the campaign. It was a great performance from both teams which have quality players capable to make big impact in tense encounters. Azam, on the other hand, had themselves to blame as they failed to transform hosts of chances they created in both halves into goals with Donald Ngoma and Obrey Chirwa leading the team’s firing department. The Jangwani Street based side displayed m a s s i v e d e f e n - s i v e a b i l - i t y , which was manned by Abdallah Shaibu, who executed well his roles in t h e absence of Kelvin Yondani, who is still serving a three match ban. “I say this over and over again that if we had wingers who are fast enough like those of Azam, we could have beaten them (Azam) by at least four goals,” said Zahera. He added that his strategy on the day was to let Azam dominate ball possession, while waiting to make quick counter attacks. “As you saw, our opponents had only one big chance early in the first half while the other opportunities they made during the battle were not enough to trouble us,” the Congolese coach said. On his part, Azam Coach Abdul Mingange said his players lacked maturity which made them to misuse the few scoring chances they created. “Whenever you play against big teams like Yanga, you need to concentrate hundred per cent such that any mistake you commit, expect to be punished,” he said. He added that to be mature in football does not mean to have aged but rather awareness to make right decision at the right time.
