EDUCATION, Science and Technology Minister, Prof Joyce Ndalichako has advised higher learning institutions to increase the number of their research publications to help Tanzania Universities to score high in the international ranking. Prof Ndalichako made the remarks in Dar es Salaam yesterday, while winding up a seminar on Research Week at the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM). The minister said that the number of research publications in the country’s Universities do not reflect the number of researches done locally, saying that Tanzania Universities should increase efforts in such research publications. “I call upon Researchers in higher learning institutions in the country to ensure the number of their research publications is increased in order to compete with other universities in the world,” Prof Ndalichako pointed out. According to her, research activities should be improved and promoted in the universities as a way of achieving sustainable development through research findings. “As we know that the Fifth Phase government under Dr John Magufuli focuses on building industrial economy. Through research activities, we shall contribute in achieving the government industrial development goal,” she noted. On his part, the University of Dar es Salaam Vice Chancellor, Prof William Anangisye challenged researchers and academicians to engage in more researches and publications or risk being transferred to Secondary Schools. “We need to engage in publications, if this is difficult for some of us, then we should get prepared to teach in Secondary Schools,” he said.
