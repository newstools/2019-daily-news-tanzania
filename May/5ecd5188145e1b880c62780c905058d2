THE government has promised to intervene in the ongoing demolition exercise at Kisokwe and Mloganzila wards in Dar es Salaam, currently being executed by the Tanzania People’s Defence Forces (TPDF). The move comes after Kibamba Lawmaker, John Mnyika stood in parliament after the Question and Answers session yesterday, seeking the Speaker’s guidance over what he termed as invasion on his voters by TPDF. He said some houses had been gutted down by fire while others demolished by the military officials, adding that some residents were sleeping outside. He requested the House Speaker, Job Ndugai to suspend a debate on the Ministry of Water to debate the issue, which he said was an urgent matter aimed at rescuing residents in Kibamba constituency. The MP also wanted Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa to send a team of three ministers—Minister of Lands, Housing and Human Settlement Development, Home Affairs and that of Defence and National Service to go to Dar es Salaam and see how best they can resolve the ongoing dispute between the military and civilians. “The assessment for compensation to area residents so that they can vacate their areas to pave way for the construction of the Standard Gauge Railway is still ongoing, but residents are now caught unawares by demolition of their houses,’’ said the Kibamba MP. But the Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office responsible for Parliamentary Affairs, Labour, Youth and the Disabled, Jenister Mhagama asked the MP to allow the government look into the matter. “I have just learned now from the MP that there is such an exercise going on, but I had no information so far, I request that instead of suspending business in parliament to debate the issue, the government must be given ample time to see how best we can handle that situation,’’ pleaded Ms Mhagama who doubles as the government Chief Whip in the House. The House Speaker concurred with the government’s request, asking Mr Mnyika to remain calm as the government continues to look for best ways to work on the ongoing exercise.
