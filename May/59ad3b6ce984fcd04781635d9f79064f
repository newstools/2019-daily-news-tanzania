MINISTER for Trade and Industry Mr Joseph Kakunda has asked the Global Standards One - Tanzanian branch (GS1-Tanzania) to collaborate with other authorities to reach all nearby markets and verify qualities of commodities which enter the country to safeguard health of consumers from under substandard goods. Minister Kakunda made the appeal over the weekend when inaugurating the GS1 new board in Dar es Salaam. The minister further added that, functions and services of GS1 are highly needed in Tanzania as the country is pushing forward industrial economy agenda as the locally produced goods will require access to market inside and outside the country. “Before establishment of GS1 Tanzania during the year 2011, many produced commodities from Tanzania were being taken by merchants from our local markets and rebranded and sold in Kenyan market due to lack of global standard code,” he said. Meanwhile, management of GS1 Tanzania and Tanzania Standards Newspapers Limited (TSN) has signed business partnership during the event. Chairman of GS1Tz’s new board of director Mr Jumbe Menye at his welcome remarks noted that GS1 Tanzania is ready to deliver goals as per government expectation but only need assistance from the minister to ensure smooth working conditions from other public authorities
