OMAN government has allocated 10bn/- for the renovation of Zanzibar’s House of Wonders, Beit- Al-Ajaib, the largest and tallest historic building located at the Isles world heritage site of Stone Town, the Minister for Information, Culture and Antiquities, Mr Mahmoud Thabit Kombo told the House yesterday. The minister said the lucratively financed renovation seeks to give the landmark building a facelift, giving it its former beauty, as one of the strategies aimed at boosting the number of tourists visiting the spicy Islands. The initial work to prevent the structure from collapsing is complete, according to Mr Kombo, who expressed optimism that the house, which occupies a prominent place facing the Forodhani Gardens on the old town’s seafront, in Mizingani Road, can withstand periods of heavy rain. It involved installation of iron posts and minor restoration works at a cost of 250m/- donated by the government of Oman, noted the minister, adding that the government will soon open tender for the grand renovation project. “The renovation of the Beit-al-Ajaib is being carried out in phases, the work has not stopped, our dear friends in Oman have allocated huge amounts of money to fund this project,” said Mr Kombo. The Beit-Al-Ajaib is one of six palaces built by Barghash bin Said, the second Sultan of Zanzibar, and it is said to be located on the site of the 17th-century palace of Zanzibari queen Fatuma. The palace was built in 1883 and was intended as a ceremonial palace and official reception hall, celebrating modernity, and it was named “House of Wonders” because it was the first building in Zanzibar to have electricity, and also the first building in East Africa to have an elevator. The House of Wonders currently houses the Museum of History and Culture of Zanzibar and the Swahili Coast.
