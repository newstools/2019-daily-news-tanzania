THE Management of Azam FC yesterday declined to comment on the recent rumours that the midfielder Tafadzwa Kutinyu has inked a twoyear deal with Horoya AC from Guinea. Reports that the Zimbabwean international has signed the contract went viral on various social media platforms leaving many people with unanswered questions. But, in an exclusive interview with the ‘Daily News’, Azam FC Communication Officer Jafar Idd said he is not aware of such issue. “At the moment, I cannot say anything regarding that topic because the league is not yet over and as a club, all issues regarding player transfers will be accomplished at the end of the season,” he said. Azam are currently on the third spot of the Mainland Premier League standings with 72 points from 37 games. They have scored 52 goals and conceded 21 and recorded 20 wins, 12 draws and 5 loses. Tomorrow, Azam play their last game of the campaign against Young Africans at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam. However, despite missing the chance to clinch the top flight league title, Azam still have a chance to win silverware this season as they expect to face debutants Lipuli FC in the Azam Sports Federation Cup (ASFC) finals slated on June 1st at Ilulu Stadium in Lindi. The Ice cream makers cruised into the finale after defeating KMC 1-0 at Azam Complex in Dar es Salaam with Donald Ngoma making the difference on the day. Similarly, Lipuli outclassed Yanga 2-0 at Samora Stadium in Iringa to win a ticket into the finals whose overall winner represent the country in CAF Confederation Cup competition. If Azam win the ASFC title, they will become the first team to bag it twice since all the past three winners (Yanga, Simba and Mtibwa Sugar) have each bagged it once.
