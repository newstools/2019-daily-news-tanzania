IN a bid to address road accident in the country, Police in Dodoma Region have managed to organise road safety education to at least one million people in the area in a period of four months. The area Regional Traffic Officer (RTO), Nuru Selemani Suleiman said his team has focused mostly to meet the citizens in market places, bus stands and other public gatherings with the education. “We are using public gatherings like markets, bus stands and in commuter buses to impart road safety knowledge to the general public,” he pointed out. That was part of his address, while opening a Road Safety Training here, adding that journalists from various media houses were also involved. He said the reporters formed part of his team because they are major ambassadors and pillars in information spread and form strong bridge between the State and the public. On his part, Abdallah Msuya, an alumni of the Road Safety Training Fellowship, advised the public to take heed of any information passed to them by the Traffic Department to reduce road accidents in the country. Equally, Ms Neema Ahmed, a lawyer from Tanzania Women Lawyers association (TAWLA) advised the media to advocate for proper use of helmets, not only to adult passengers, but also to children, who may form part of passengers in private cars, where fastening of the seat belts is mandatory.
