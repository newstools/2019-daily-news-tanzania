THE Ministry of Energy said yesterday that rural electrification project should reach all beneficiaries at set timeframe. To make sure the project implemented as designed, the Energy Minister, Dr Medard Kalemani, asked Rural Energy Authority (REA) to make sure they connect all rural dwellers, regardless of remoteness of the area, in time set. “The government’s vision is to connect all villages to electricity regardless of their remoteness,” Dr Kalemani ordered REA when addressing a public rally at Miono village in Chalinze, Bagamoyo. The minister later officiated the launching of the power connection service to two villages in Mkwajuni and Makao Makuu. The Minister told the rally that the cost of installing electricity is 27,000/- only both for homes and institutions in the rural areas that are served by REA. On top of that Dr Kalemani showed his dissatisfaction on the pace of connecting electricity demonstrated by Tanesco and REA to Chalinze households. Earlier, the Member of Parliament for Chalinze constituency Mr Ridhiwan Kikwete told the Minister that there were three wards which are not yet connected to power supply. They are Talawanda, Mkange and Kibindu. Responding, the Minister promised that he will intensify supervision of the ongoing projects and see that the work is completed soon after new budget is passed. Currently MPs are debating the 2019/2020 budget.
