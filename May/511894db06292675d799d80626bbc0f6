CONGOLESE giants TP Mazembe have written to Young Africans showing intention to snatch Ibrahim Ajib Migomba whose contract with the club expires on June 30 this year. In the letter signed by TP Mazembe secretary general Frederick Kitenge and the administrative secretary Dony Kabongo, the Lubumbashi-based side want to sign Ajib as a free agent by July 1st since by then his contract with Yanga will be expired. “In this regard we advise that in conformity with FIFA Statutes, specifically, the regulations for status and transfer of players, TP Mazembe has entered into contractual agreement with the named player effective, 1st July, 2019,” said part of the letter. Ajib has, however, yet to confirm whether he will stay at Jangwani Street next season. Prior to TP Mazembe official interest in him, there were rumours circulating that Ajib might re-join Simba. Ajib, who officially joined Yanga on July 5, 2017, has been the key player for the team playing both as an attacking midfielder and as a striker.
