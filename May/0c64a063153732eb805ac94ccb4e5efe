THE Higher Education Students Loans Board (HESLB) is set to link its information systems with that of the National Identification Authority (NIDA) and other public entities in scrutinizing loan applicants, towards improving the issuance of loans. The Parliament heard that the board would also incorporate details of the applicants from the Registration Insolvency and Trusteeship Agency (RITA) as well as Social Security Regulatory Authority (SSRA). The government announced the new move during the debate of the budget of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology which was concluded on Tuesday. The Parliament endorsed the ministry’s proposed 1.3tri/-  budget  for the 2019/20 financial year. Finance and Planning Minister Dr Philip Mpango  has advised the board to prepare proposals for the government to separate its budget from the main development budget of the ministry. The ministry’s Deputy Minister William ole Nasha said in February this year that HESLB officials met those of NIDA to prepare procedures for linking the information systems of the two institutions. The board also continues to hold discussions with RITA and SSRA for the same purpose of enhancing efficiency in providing loans. Clarifying on some students missing loans, Mr Nasha said loans were given to needy applicants and the procedures were subjected to laws governing the board, taking into account applicants’ qualifications, including being citizens. However, he said there was a challenge of applicants failing to provide proper information to the board. He cited the 2018/19 case, whereby 16,797 first year students presented wrong information. He asked students applying for loans to ensure that they fill application forms properly. During this financial year, the board has enlightened at least 25,000 students on how to apply for loans.
