EDUCATION and awareness campaigns are now frequently needed to rescue young girls who are being lured to premarital sex, with additional bait that it is only naked sex that makes them become pregnant and dangerous, a voluntary Non-Governmental Organisation has said. The Children’s Dignity Forum (CDF) in collaboration with several NGOs including Equality Now meeting for a workshop on sexual harassment here, recently, further aired different painful testimonies of girls in Primary and Secondary Schools, who have fallen in the trap. A facilitator, Ms Hawa Said, a Project Manager from one of the projects- ‘Magauni Manne from Dodoma Youth Development Organisation, described a recent case in Dodoma City, where a Schoolgirl confided to her male partner and frequently engaged in anal sex with claims that it was safe and would not result into pregnancy. “There are many girls who are being convinced by men into this unethical behaviour, therefore, we need to educate them on the effects of anal intercourse,’’ she pointed out, adding that even pregnancies for girls aged 18 years and below, were still alarming. On his side, a representative from Equality Now, Florence Machio said his organisation has been running ‘healthy talks’ with schoolboys in six African countries of Gambia, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya and Mauritania to discourage them from premature sex. Reached for a comment, the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, Community Development Officer, Ms Imelda Kamugisha said she had been receiving appalling cases from spouses once some girls get married, before they even attain adult ages.
