GOVERNMENT and stakeholders of sports have been encouraged to come forward and support para sport activities as one way to promote inclusive culture in sports discipline. The call was made recently in Dar es Salaam by Agitos Foundation Programme Coordinator Sheila Mogelo during her visit at Stingrays Swim Club which currently accommodates 14 para swimmers. “ We are living in the world where people should be urged to embrace inclusive culture in all spheres of life especially sports since it has the power to bring together persons regardless of gender, age and race,” Mogelo said. She added that her foundation works abreast with various stakeholders worldwide in trying to foster the culture of inclusive programmes and discourage stigma in the process. “ I am impressed upon seeing that here in Tanzania, inclusive programmes in sports are being promoted but we still need to push for more support so as to attract as many people with impairment to join various sport activities which are available across the nation,” she said. On his part, Stingrays Swim Club coach Ramadhani Namkoveka said he was thrilled to host Mogelo who had time to see training sessions of the para swimmers present at the club conducted at Nordic School in the city. “ As you know, our club is the first in the country to have para swimmers who are training hard so as to stand a chance of competing in various international contests coming ahead,” Namkoveka said. He further revealed that at the moment, they are waiting official confirmation from the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) for them to compete in the upcoming World Para Swimming Championship set in September late this year in London.
