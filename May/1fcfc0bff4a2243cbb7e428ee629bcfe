SOME 1,237 cases of the dengue haemorrhagic fever have been reported in Dar es Salaam, Tanga and Singida regions as of May since the outbreak of the mosquito-borne tropical disease in January. The figures were disclosed here yesterday by Chief Medical Officer, Prof Mohammed Kambi, pointing out that 1,150 of the cases were reported in Dar es Salaam, 86 cases in Tanga and one case in Singida. “The number of dengue fever cases has been on the increase for the past four months since the outbreak of the fever in January when 56 cases were reported,” said the Chief Medical Officer at a media briefing session. Prof Kambi explained thatat least 82 cases of dengue fever were reported in February, 159 cases in March, and 940 in April, pointing out that two dengue related deaths had been reported so far. However, he said, the people suspected to have died as a result of dengue fever were also suffering from other diseases, urging members of the public to take precautions against the disease. Prof Kambi cited symptoms of dengue fever as sudden onset fever, headache (typically located behind the eyes) muscle and joint pains and rash and that signs appear after three days or 14 days after infection. He said in some people, the disease proceeds to a critical phase as fever resolves, saying during the period, there is leakage of plasma from blood vessels typically lasting one to two days. “This may result in fluid accumulation in the chest and abdominal cavity as well as depletion of fluid from the circulation and decreased blood supply to vital organs,” he said. As for prevention against the disease, he said people must take steps to clear mosquito breeding sites and using mosquito treated nets, adding that those feeling fever must seek medical treatment at health facilities. Prof Kambi said the government, through regional authorities, was monitoring prevalence of the dengue virus in order to control it.
