FIVE children who were sponsored by the Tulia Trust Institute to pursue their secondary education in Nigeria are progressing well and their performance is superb, the Instituteâ€™s Project Manager, Jackline Boaz, has said. Six months ago, Tulia Trust in collaboration with Rochas Foundation College of Africa, sponsored Anna Shitindi, Ayubu Mwaihola, Suzana Mwakilima, Bernada Fuime and Beuti Msinge to study in the West African country after they had accomplished their Standard Seven education in Tanzania. Founded in 2015 by Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly Dr Tulia Ackson, The Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) focuses on health and education issues in the country by helping a number of vulnerable children.
