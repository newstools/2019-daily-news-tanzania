THE government here has assured international tourists that they are in safe hands while in Zanzibar, saying the level of security has intensified. Deputy Minister for State, President’s Office, Regional Administration, Local Government and Special Departments, Mr Shamata Shaame Khamis said the government has made efforts to secure the country. “A great deal of measures has been taken to address security challenges, and we have controlled crime incidents against tourists,” the Deputy Minister told the House when issuing clarification on the safety and security of guests who visit Zanzibar, notably tourists. He cited the installation of CCTV cameras in all Stone Town streets as among security measures taken by the government to make the area, which is the gateway to tourist destinations, secure. “The issue of safety and security of tourists is not for compromise, we’re well organised in ensuring that to a large extent we control crime incidents,” stated Mr Khamis. He said there are also regular police patrols in areas where tourists frequent as well as around tourist hotels as part of security measures. The deputy minister also advised hotel owners to use guards from JKU, noting that JKU is the only institution which has legal mandate to provide security services.
