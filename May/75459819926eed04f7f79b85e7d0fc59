MWANZA Archdiocese Archbishop Renatus Nkwande yesterday expressed dismay over witchcraft believers, denouncing them as primitive. “Every time a person’s stomach swells, you say he or she has been bewitched and go further to name someone as the witch. That is primitive, lack of religious belief and failure to believe in Almighty God,” Archbishop Nkwande charged. He made the statement during the Mass to install him as head of the Catholic Church in Mwanza at Kawekamo grounds in the rocky city. “People have been unimportant things…they brought homosexuality, we copied, they brought abortion, we also imitated…there are even some institutions today supplying kits for abortion and we are just watching.” He said the country’s forefathers were tired of colonialism and that is why they fought for independence. “Let’s today fight against homosexuality and abortion…abortion is murder, it’s a sin. Some people among us should come out and get rid of colonialism mentality in their minds,” he stated. He further used the platform to thank President John Magufuli for the great job he is doing in bringing development for Tanzanians and reducing poverty. Tanzania Episcopal Conference (TEC) President Archbishop Gervas Nyaisonga asked the Catholics in the Lake Zone to embrace unity and accord the newly installed Archbishop Nkwande the cooperation he deserves.
