UNIVERSITY of Dodoma (UDOM) Lecturer Dr Ombeni Msuya has proposed introduction of anticorruption subject in the curriculum of all levels of education to prepare a corruption free society. Addressing students at UDOM campus over the weekend, Dr Msuya said the subject will help to raise awareness on corruption effects, saying it will also reinvigorate the war against corruption in the country. “It is vital to have anti-corruption subject in university because here is the last place to prepare members of the public before taking over official duties,” said the don who doubles as patron to UDOM students’ organisation against corruption (UDOSOAC) during a seminar on corruption. The seminar, which was organised by UDOSOAC, brought together the organisation’s members as well as students from College of Natural and Mathematical Sciences (CNMS) at UDOM. Dr Msuya said the establishment of UDOSOAC has helped to raise awareness among UDOM students and academic staff on corruption, arguing that UDOSOAC has provided students with an ideal platform to share information on effects of corruption.
